           "abstract": "The increase of CO2 level in atmosphere becomes one of the driving forces for research on functional materials. Capturing and utilizing of CO2 are more important than ever, both to reduce CO2 emission and to increase the economic value of CO2 derivatives. In this study, synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) was conducted by combining Zn2+ metal nodes and 2-methylimidazolate ligand to form zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) materials. ZIF-8 was synthesised with the addition of sodium chloride to modulate the crystal morphology during the in-situ synthesis, using either water or methanol as the solvent. According to the refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, the ZIF-8 materials were successfully prepared and have unit cell parameters that are reasonably close to the available standard. The formation of ZIF-8 is also confirmed by IR spectroscopy, which reveals the stretching vibration mode of Zn−N from the coordination between Zn2+ and 2-methylimidazolate ligand. The crystal morphology exhibits different shape, as observed in SEM and TEM studies, with the dominant shape being a rhombic dodecahedron. The interaction between ZIF-8 and CO2 was investigated via ex-situ IR spectroscopy, combined with several computational techniques such as density functional theory and molecular dynamics, to elucidate the nature of the CO2 binding sites.

           "abstract": "Due to their vast range of promising biomedical and electronic applications, there is a growing interest in bioinorganic lamellar nanomaterials. MXenes are one such class of materials, which stand out by virtue of their demonstrated biocompatibility, pharmacological applicability, energy storage performance, and feasibility as single-molecule sensors. Here, we report on first-principles predictions, based on density functional theory, of the binding energies and ground-state configurations of six selected amino acids (AAs) adsorbed on O-terminated two-dimensional titanium carbide, Ti2CO2. We find that most AAs (aspartic acid, cysteine, glycine, and phenylalanine) prefer to adsorb via their nitrogen atom, which forms a weak bond with a surface Ti atom, with bond lengths of around 2.35 Å. In contrast, histidine and serine tend to adsorb parallel to the MXene surface, with their α carbon about 3 Å away from it. In both adsorption configurations, the adsorption energies are on the order of the tenths of an electronvolt. In addition, we find a positive, nearly linear correlation between the binding energy of each studied AA and its van der Waals volume, which suggests an adsorption dominated by van der Waals forces. This relationship allowed us to predict the adsorption energies for all of the proteinogenic AAs on the same Ti2CO2 MXene. Our analysis additionally shows that in the parallel adsorption mode there is a negligible transfer of charge density from the AA to the surface but noticeable in the N-bonded adsorption mode. In the latter, the isosurfaces of charge density differences show accumulation of shared electrons in the region between N and Ti, confirming the predicted N–Ti bond. The moderate adsorption energy values calculated, as well as the preservation of the integrity of both the AAs and the surface upon adsorption, reinforce the capability of Ti2CO2 as a promising reusable biosensor for amino acids.",

Technol. 2024, 330, 125545). However, accessing their atom-level structures remain extremely challenging due to crystallization difficulties caused by ligand’s lipophilicity and nitrate ions’s disturbance as well as the scarcity of americium. In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations to elucidate the coordination behavior of americium and europium ions in the presence of NTAamide and nitrate counterions. For the first time, the neutral complex is identified as [M(NTAamide)2(NO3)](NO3)2 (M = Am and Eu). One nitrate ion chelates the metal center in the first coordination sphere, while two additional nitrates are weakly coupling in the outer sphere. Totally, the metal in the complex exhibits a tenfold coordination, encompassing six carbonyl oxygen and two nitrogen atoms from NTAamides. This configuration is further confirmed by MD simulations, where a large number of nitric acid and water molecules are explicitly considered. Further elaboration is conducted by DFT calculations on systems of [M(NTAamide)2]3+ with varying nitrate ions in terms of thermodynamics, bondings and geometric/electronic structures.",

Cooperative structural transitions involve the concerted displacement of molecules in a crystalline material, as opposed to typical molecule-by-molecule nucleation and growth mechanisms which often break single crystallinity. Cooperative transitions have acquired much attention for low transition barriers, ultrafast kinetics, and structural reversibility. However, cooperative transitions are rare in molecular crystals and their origin is poorly understood. Crystals of 2-dimensional quinoidal terthiophene (2DQTT-o-B), a high-performance n-type organic semiconductor, demonstrate two distinct thermally activated phase transitions following these mechanisms. Here we show reorientation of the alkyl side chains triggers cooperative behavior, tilting the molecules like dominos. Whereas, nucleation and growth transition is coincident with increasing alkyl chain disorder and driven by forming a biradical state. We establish alkyl chain engineering as integral to rationally controlling these polymorphic behaviors for novel electronic applications.",

           "abstract": "The design of novel materials requires a theoretical understanding of dynamical processes in the solid state, including polymorphic transitions and associated pathways. The organization of the potential energy landscape plays a crucial role in such processes, which may involve changes in the periodic boundaries. This study reports the implementation of a general framework for periodic condensed matter systems in our energy landscape analysis software, allowing for variation in both the unit cell and atomic positions. This implementation provides access to basin-hopping global optimization, the doubly nudged elastic band procedure for identifying transition state candidates, the missing connection approach for multi-step pathways, and general tools for the construction and analysis of kinetic transition networks. The computational efficacy of the procedures is explored using the state-of-the-art semiempirical method GFN1-xTB for the first time in this solid-state context. We investigate the effectiveness of this level of theory by characterizing the potential energy and enthalpy landscapes of several systems, including silicon, CdSe, ZnS, and NaCl, and discuss further technical challenges, such as translational permutation of the cell. Despite the expected limitations of the semiempirical method, we find that the resulting energy landscapes provide useful insight into solid-state simulations, which will facilitate detailed analysis of processes such as defect and ion migration, including refinement at higher levels of theory.",

           "abstract": "We have studied the clusters involved in the initial stages of nucleation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks, employing a wide range of computational techniques. In the pre-nucleating solution, the prevalent cluster is the ZnIm4 cluster (formed by a zinc cation, Zn2+, and four imidazolate anions, Im−), although clusters such as ZnIm3, Zn2Im7, Zn2Im7, Zn3Im9, Zn3Im10, or Zn4Im12 have energies that are not much higher, so they would also be present in solution at appreciable quantities. All these species, except ZnIm3, have a tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2+ cation. Small ZnxImy clusters are less stable than the ZnIm4 cluster. The first cluster that is found to be more stable than ZnIm4 is the Zn41Im88 cluster, which is a disordered cluster with glassy structure. Bulk-like clusters do not begin to be more stable than glassy clusters until much larger sizes, since the larger cluster we have studied (Zn144Im288) is still less stable than the glassy Zn41Im88 cluster, suggesting that Ostwald's rule (the less stable polymorph crystallizes first) could be fulfilled, not for kinetic, but for thermodynamic reasons. Our results suggest that the first clusters formed in the nucleation process would be glassy clusters, which then undergo transformation to any of the various crystal structures possible, depending on the kinetic routes provided by the synthesis conditions. Our study helps elucidate the way in which the various species present in solution interact, leading to nucleation and crystal growth.",

           "abstract": "Phosphate groups are ubiquitous in biomolecules and are usually incorporated through phosphoester bonds between alcohol groups and orthophosphate. The formation of this bond is exceptionally difficult, with associated barriers of 30–45 kcal/mol in the absence of catalysts. In abiotic conditions, polymerizing nucleic acids without enzymes remains very challenging and is still a partly unsolved problem that severely questions the RNA World hypothesis for the origins of life. Offering a solution to this problem would involve a detailed knowledge of the reaction energetics and mechanisms, yet these remain not fully understood at a molecular level, especially because of the very slow reaction rates that represent a significant challenge for the experiments. The number of involved reaction coordinates and the possible role of the solvent in assisting the reaction are challenging for computational studies. Here, we use extensive ab initio molecular dynamics simulations using semiempirical tight-binding methods and enhanced sampling to address these issues. We first show that the choice of the tight-binding method is greatly limited by the instability of the water liquid phase for most DFTB generations and parameter sets that are widely available. We then focus on a model reaction involving methanol and orthophosphate, for which the two protonation states (mono- and dianionic) that are dominant around neutral pH are considered. We compare different proton coordinates that enable (or not) the participation of solvent water molecules. Our simulations suggest that in all cases, a dissociative associative mechanism, with an intermediate metaphosphate, is favored. The main difference between the two phosphate species is that reaction with the monoanion is assisted by the substrate, while that with the dianion involves solvent water molecules. Our results are in agreement with early experimental measurements, but the reaction barriers are underestimated in our framework. We believe that our approach provides an interesting perspective on how to sample the reaction phase space efficiently, but it calls for future studies using more accurate descriptions of chemical reactivity.",

           "abstract": "The dangers posed by nuclear accidents necessitate developments in techniques for cesium removal. One such is the adsorption of cesium cations in Prussian blue (PB) materials, on which adsorption can be a substation process or pure physisorption. The underlying mechanism of the latter is not well understood, although a Langmuir isotherm is frequently used to model experimental results. In this work, we exploit tight-binding density-functional theory (DFTB) methods to probe the atomic interactions in the physisorption process. The results show that there is a diminishing return for the energy of adsorption as more sites are filled. This means that the adsorption sites are not independent, as stipulated by the ideal Langmuir isotherm. Instead, the results indicate that electrostatic effects need to be considered to explain the theoretical and experimental results. Therefore, an electrostatic Langmuir (EL) model is introduced, which contains an electrostatic ideality correction to the classic Langmuir isotherm. For future materials development, these physical insights indicate that shielding effects as well as the number of independent physical sites must be considered when synthesizing effective Prussian blue analogs (PBA). In conclusion, the study provides insights into the limiting mechanisms in the physisorption of cesium cations on PB.",

           "abstract": "Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) form crystals with large lattice voids that are suitable for the capture, transport and storage of various interstitial ions. Recently, we introduced the concept of a ladder mechanism to describe how sodium ions inside a PBA crystal structure diffuse by climbing the frames formed by aligned cyanide groups in the host structure. The current work uses semi-empirical tight-binding density functional theory (DFTB) in a multiscale approach to investigate how differences in the size of the monovalent cation affect the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the diffusion process. The results show that the ladder mechanism represents a unified framework, from which both similarities and differences between cation types can be understood. Fundamental Coulombic interactions make all positive cations avoid the open vacant areas in the structure, while cavities surrounded by partially negatively charged cyanide groups form diffusion bottlenecks and traps for larger cations. These results provide a new and quantitative way of understanding the suppression of cesium adsorption that has previously been reported for PBAs characterized by a low vacancy density. In conclusion, this work provides a unified picture of the cation adsorption in PBAs based on the newly formulated ladder mechanism.",

           "abstract": "As climate change continues to pose a threat to the Earth due to the disrupted carbon cycles and fossil fuel resources remain finite, new sources of sustainable hydrocarbons must be explored. 2,3-butanediol is a potential source to produce butene because of its sustainability as a biomass-derived sugar. Butene is an attractive product because it can be used as a precursor to jet fuel, categorizing this work in the alcohol-to-jet pathway. While studies have explored the conversion of 2,3-butanediol to butene, little is understood about the fundamental reaction itself. We quantify the energetics for three pathways that were reported in the literature in the absence of a catalyst. One of these pathways forms a 1,3-butadiene intermediate, which is a highly exothermic process and thus is unlikely to occur since 2,3-butanediol likely gets thermodynamically trapped at this intermediate. We further determined the corresponding energetics of 2,3-butanediol adsorption on an ensemble of predetermined binding sites when it interacts with a defect-free stoichiometric RuO2(110) surface. Within this ensemble of adsorption sites, the most favorable site has 2,3-butanediol covering a Ru 5–coordinated cation. This approach is compared to that obtained using the global optimization algorithm as implemented in the Northwest Potential Energy Surface Search Engine. When using such a global optimization algorithm, we determined a more favorable ground-state structure that was missed during the manual adsorption site testing, with an adsorption energy of −2.61 eV as compared to −2.34 eV when using the ensemble-based approach. We hypothesize that the dehydration reaction requires a stronger chemical bond, which could necessitate the formation of oxygen vacancies. As such, this study has taken the first step toward the utilization of a global optimization algorithm for the rational design of Ru-based catalysts toward the formation of butene from sustainable resources.",

           "abstract": "Interstellar Grains (IGs) spread in the Interstellar Medium (ISM) host a multitude of chemical reactions that could lead to the production of interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs), relevant in the context of prebiotic chemistry. These IGs are composed of a silicate-based core covered by several layers of amorphous water ice, known as a grain mantle. Molecules from the ISM gas-phase can be adsorbed at the grain surfaces, diffuse and react to give iCOMs and ultimately desorbed back to the gas phase. Thus, the study of the Binding Energy (BE) of these molecules at the water ice grain surface is important to understand the molecular composition of the ISM and its evolution in time. In this paper, we propose to use a recently developed semiempirical quantum approach, named GFN-xTB, and more precisely the GFN2 method, to compute the BE of several molecular species at the crystalline water ice slab model. This method is very cheap in term of computing power and time and was already showed in a previous work to be very accurate with small water clusters. To support our proposition, we decided to use, as a benchmark, the recent work published by some of us in which a crystalline model of proton-ordered water ice (P-ice) was adopted to predict the BEs of 21 molecules relevant in the ISM. The relatively good results obtained confirm GFN2 as the method of choice to model adsorption processes occurring at the icy grains in the ISM. The only notable exception was for the CO molecule, in which both structure and BE are badly predicted by GFN2, a real pity due to the relevance of CO in astrochemistry.",

           "abstract": "To improve the description of interactions among the localized d, f electrons in transition metals, we have introduced a ligand-field motivated contribution into the Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model. Referred to as DFTB3+U, the approach treats the d, f electron repulsions with rotationally invariant orbital–orbital interactions and a Hartree–Fock model; this represents a major conceptual improvement over the original DFTB3 approach, which treats the d, f-shell interactions in a highly averaged fashion without orbital level of description. The DFTB3+U approach is tested using a series of nickel compounds that feature Ni(II) and Ni(III) oxidation states. By using parameters developed with the original DFTB3 Hamiltonian and empirical +U parameters (F0/2/4 Slater integrals), we observe that the DFTB3+U model indeed provides substantial improvements over the original DFTB3 model for a number of properties of the nickel compounds, including the population and spin polarization of the d-shell, nature of the frontier orbitals, ligand field splitting and the energy different between low and high spin states at OPBE optimized structures. This proof-of-concept study suggests that with self-consistent parameterization of the electronic and +U parameters, the DFTB3+U model can develop into a promising model that can be used to efficiently study reactive events involving transition metals ion condensed phase systems. The methodology can be integrated with other approximate QM methods as well, such as the extended tight binding (xTB) approach.",

           "abstract": "In recent years, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) for optoelectronic applications have attracted the attention of the scientific community due to their outstanding performance. The fundamental understanding of their physicochemical properties is essential for improving their efficiency and stability. Atomistic and molecular simulations have played an essential role in the description of the optoelectronic properties and dynamical behavior of MHPs, respectively. However, the complex interplay of the dynamical and optoelectronic properties in MHPs requires the simultaneous modeling of electrons and ions in relatively large systems, which entails a high computational cost, sometimes not affordable by the standard quantum mechanics methods, such as density functional theory (DFT). Here, we explore the suitability of the recently developed density functional tight binding method, GFN1-xTB, for simulating MHPs with the aim of exploring an efficient alternative to DFT. The performance of GFN1-xTB for computing structural, vibrational, and optoelectronic properties of several MHPs is benchmarked against experiments and DFT calculations. In general, this method produces accurate predictions for many of the properties of the studied MHPs, which are comparable to DFT and experiments. We also identify further challenges in the computation of specific geometries and chemical compositions. Nevertheless, we believe that the tunability of GFN1-xTB offers opportunities to resolve these issues and we propose specific strategies for the further refinement of the parameters, which will turn this method into a powerful computational tool for the study of MHPs and beyond.",

The resulting ZnPc−BTBT and ZnPc−(BTBT)4 derivatives are the first two examples of a phthalocyanine subclass having potential use as solution-processable p-type organic semiconductors. In particular, the combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations suggests compatible energy level alignments with mixed halide hybrid perovskite-based devices. Furthermore, ZnPc−(BTBT)4 features a high aggregation tendency, a useful tool to design compact molecular films. When tested as hole transport materials in perovskite solar cells under 100 mA cm−2 standard AM 1.5G solar illumination, ZnPc−(BTBT)4 gave power conversion efficiencies as high as 14.13 %, irrespective of the doping process generally required to achieve high photovoltaic performances. This work is a first step toward a new phthalocyanine core engineerization to obtain robust, yet more efficient and cost-effective materials for organic electronics and optoelectronics.",

The GFN2-XTB method is shown to accurately reproduce previously reported and density functional theory (DFT)-calculated geometries of model systems. Molecular dynamics simulations based on this method are able to sample peptide flexibility over timescales of up to nanoseconds, but these timescales are insufficient to explore potential changes in metal–peptide binding modes. To achieve this, metadynamics simulations using root mean square deviation as a collective variable were employed. With suitably chosen biasing potentials, these are able to efficiently explore diverse coordination modes, for instance, through Glu and/or Asp residues in a model peptide. Using these methods, we find that Al(III) binding to the N-terminal sequence of amyloid-β is highly fluxional, with all acidic sidechains and several backbone oxygens participating in coordination. We also show that such simulations could provide a means to predict a priori possible binding modes as a precursor to longer, atomistic simulations.",

The obtainment of either monosulfide bridge-complex (3) or disulfide bridge-complex (4) depends on the reaction media. The structure of complex 3 was confirmed by monocrystal X-ray diffraction. Additionally it was possible to determine the presence of an intramolecular interconversion between 1 and 2 mediated by solvent molecules through the intermediate species 1-H+ using UV-Vis and NMR spectroscopy. Electronic spectra calculated by TD-DFT feature distinct MLCT transitions for 2 and show that the π-stacking interaction present in 1 is broken in the methanol/water mixture, leading to a structural distribution similar to 2. Cyclic voltammograms of all complexes display the characteristic reduction process for the rhenium center and the bipyridine ligand. Additionally, an irreversible process associated with the bridging ligand for 3 and 4 is observed.",

            "abstract": "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has a strong oxidation effect when absorbing ultraviolet light. Therefore, when TiO2 is used as a light stabilizer in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), it will cause the photodegradation of PVC. Herein, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) coated TiO2 composite (TiO2@CQDs) was prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared TiO2@CQDs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–Vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The photostability of PVC film containing TiO2@CQDs was investigated via photodegradation conductivity test, weight loss rate test, and ultraviolet aging test. Due to the down-conversion effect of CQDs under ultraviolet light, its existence can alleviate the photoaging of PVC. In addition, the thermal stability of PVC containing TiO2@CQDs was studied by conductivity tests and oven thermal aging tests. The presence of CQDs significantly improved the thermal stability of PVC. Meanwhile, the HCl absorption capacity of CQDs could reach 30.8 mg/gcat. According to the DFT calculations, this high absorption capacity is attributed to the HCl immobilization effect via forming hydrogen bonds between HCl and the keto oxygen, carboxyl keto oxygen in CQDs. The hydroxyl group in CQDs could also combine ZnCl2 by forming a coordination bond.",

It would give information about the 3D chemical structure of biological systems, which could enable unprecedented insights into biological systems and processes, such as virus protein interactions. For this future aim, we present as a first essential step the APT analysis of pure water (Milli-Q) which is the main component of biological systems. After Cryo-preparation, nanometric water tips are field evaporated with assistance by short laser pulses. The obtained data sets of several tens of millions of atoms reveal a complex evaporation behavior. Understanding the field evaporation process of water is fundamental for the measurement of more complex biological systems. For the identification of the individual signals in the mass spectrum, DFT calculations were performed to prove the stability of the detected molecules.",

The presence of H2O2 under UV and UV-LED irradiation significantly enhanced degradation efficiency. The water matrix complexity had a significant impact on process efficiency. Nitrate, chloride, and sulfate ions exhibited an inhibitory effect on nadolol degradation by quenching •OH radicals. Additional analyses, including catalase activity, lipid peroxidation, and computational analysis, revealed proposed degradation intermediates. Six degradation intermediates were proposed, along with their NMR chemical shifts. The degree of mineralization and in vitro toxicity were assessed.",

Photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS) technology has played a crucial role in detecting and quantifying KHP in recent years. However, the dissociative photoionization behavior at the near-threshold may bias the collection of KHP signals, resulting in a significant underestimation of the concentration. In the present study, the dissociative photoionization mechanism of 3-hydroperoxybutanal (3-KHP), the most abundant KHP in n-butane oxidation, was investigated by quantum chemical calculations. The results suggest that a two-step dehydration reaction channel with a low barrier accounts for the observation of fragments at the near-threshold. The appearance energy of possible fragments was obtained at a high theoretical level. The photoionization cross-sections (PICS) of 3-KHP at photon energies ranging from the threshold to 11 eV were obtained by theoretical calculations in this study. By comparing the calculated PICS with the photoionization efficiency curve measured in a previous study, we found that approximately 70% of the 3-KHP signals (m/z = 104) were converted into cation fragments (m/z = 29, 43, 71, etc.) at 10 eV. The theoretically predicted dissociative photoionization fragment information and total PICS were finally used to refine the quantification of 3-KHP in the previous experiment. Our study indicates that for highly reactive species such as KHP, theoretical investigations on the dissociative photoionization behavior and photoionization cross-section will substantially benefit the species quantification by PIMS.",

            "abstract": "Experimentally measured infrared spectra are often compared to their computed equivalents. However, the accordance is typically characterized by visual inspection, which is prone to subjective judgment. The primary challenge for a similarity-based analysis is that the artifacts introduced by each approach are very different and, therefore, may require preprocessing steps to determine and correct impeding irregularities. To allow for automated objective assessment, we propose a practical and comprehensive workflow involving scaling factors, a novel baseline correction scheme, and peak smoothing. The resulting spectra can then easily be compared quantitatively using similarity measures, for which we found the Pearson correlation coefficient to be the most suitable. The proposed procedure is then applied to compare the agreement of the experimental infrared spectra from the NIST Chemistry Web book with the calculated spectra using standard harmonic frequency analysis and spectra extracted from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at different levels of theory. We conclude that the direct, quantitative comparison of calculated and measured IR spectra might become a novel, sophisticated approach to benchmark quantum-chemical methods. In the present benchmark, simulated spectra based on ab initio molecular dynamics show in general better agreement with the experiment than static calculations.",

Interestingly, during optimisation of the synthesis a small amount of the natural product pseudopalmatine was isolated, and characterised for the first time by X-ray crystallography. Compound 3+ contains a catechol motif and positive charge on the same scaffold and was found to be a potent anion receptor, binding sulfate strongly in 8 : 2 d6-acetone:D2O and 7 : 3 d6-acetone:D2O (Ka>104 and 2,100 M−1, respectively). Unsurprisingly, chloride binding was much weaker, even in the less polar solvent mixture 9 : 1 d6-acetone:D2O. The sulfate binding is remarkably strong for such a simple molecule, however anion binding studies were complicated by the tendency of the molecule to react with BPh4− or BF4− species during anion metathesis reactions. This gave two unusual zwitterions containing tetrahedral boronate centres, which were both characterised by X-ray crystallography.",

In the uncatalyzed reaction, delitschiapyrones A and B are formed by Diels–Alder reactions through a single transition state and a post-transition state bifurcation that favors formation of delitschiapyrone B. In water and most likely in the enzyme, the acidic hydroxyquinone ionizes, and the resulting conjugate base undergoes cycloaddition preferentially to delitschiapyrone A.

            "abstract": "NMR provides both structural and dynamic information, which is key to connecting intermediates and to understanding reaction pathways. However, fast exchanging catalytic intermediates are often inaccessible by conventional NMR due its limited time resolution. Here, we show the combined application of the 1H off-resonance R1ρ NMR method and low temperature (185–175 K) to resolve intermediates exchanging on a μs time scale (ns at room temperature). The potential of the approach is demonstrated on chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysts in their complexes with imines. The otherwise inaccessible exchange kinetics of the E-I ⇌ E-II imine conformations and thermodynamic E-I:E-II imine ratios inside the catalyst pocket are experimentally determined and corroborated by calculations. The E-I ⇌ E-II exchange rate constants (kex185 K) for different catalyst–substrate binary complexes varied between 2500 and 19 000 s–1 (τex = 500–50 μs). Theoretical analysis of these exchange rate constants revealed the involvement of an intermediary tilted conformation E-III, which structurally resembles the hydride transfer transition state. The main E-I and E-II exchange pathway is a hydrogen bond strength dependent tilting–switching–tilting mechanism via a bifurcated hydrogen bond as a transition state. The reduction in the sterics of the catalyst showed an accelerated switching process by at least an order of magnitude and enabled an additional rotational pathway. Hence, the exchange process is mainly a function of the intrinsic properties of the 3,3′-substituents of the catalyst. Overall, we believe that the present study opens a new dimension in catalysis via experimental access to structures, populations, and kinetics of catalyst–substrate complexes on the μs time scale by the 1H off-resonance R1ρ method.",

            "abstract": "In the present study, thermally averaged electronic excitation energies (the so-called dynamic approach) are quantitatively assessed for a model molecular system composed of a series of increasingly longer chains of simple linear polyenes. The molecular dynamics trajectories are calculated using the semi-empirical “Geometry, Frequency, Noncovalent, eXtended Tight Binding” (GFN2-xTB) method, while TD-DFT vertical excitation energies of selected snapshots are obtained with the spin-component-scaled double hybrid density functional SCS-wPBEPP86. Boltzmann weighted average excitation energies were then calculated in order to take into account the contribution of thermal motions. Excitation energies via the dynamic approach are compared with that of the static approach in which thermal fluctuations are not considered. The differences between the dynamic and the static approaches were found to be around the range −0.01 to +0.01 eV for polyenes up to 44 carbon atoms. This range of errors is relatively small in comparison with typical errors produced by using different density functionals and/or basis sets. Therefore, the electronic excited states of small to medium lengths of linear polyenes (less than 50 carbon atoms) can be safely modeled via the static approach. However, extrapolation of the results to longer polyenes indicates that the difference between both approaches is estimated to be 0.05 eV for polyenes containing 100 carbon atoms, which suggests that considering thermal motions in the calculations of excitation energies is recommended for such long conjugated molecular systems.",

However, the viability of application of those systems in such processes is still under investigation, in which the comprehension of the fundamental aspects that govern the metal extraction is essential and can be further constructed using computational approaches. This research paper presents a comprehensive computational study on the fundamental nature of metal extraction in polymer-salt aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS), comparing the results of modeling and simulation work to the theoretical and experimental data available in the literature. Specifically, the mechanisms underlying the extraction of Co2+, Ni2+, and Fe3+, in ATPS formed by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and thiocyanate salt are investigated, using quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The formation of pseudo-polycations (PPCs) and thiocyanate metalates (complexes formed by a metal cation bonded to one or more anions) and the interaction of PEO fragments, thiocyanate, and aquo ligands with metal cations are explored. The binding affinity of these species is evaluated from various perspectives, including structural, electronic, and thermodynamic considerations. The solvation behavior of the species in solvents with different polarities is also examined. The findings elucidate the mechanisms governing metal cations partitioning behavior in PEO/thiocyanate ATPS, confirming the mechanisms proposed previously in the literature, involving charge transfer between metal-thiocyanate complexes and polyethylene oxide ether groups as well as interactions between metalate and PPCs. This study represents the first-ever computational investigation into the molecular driving forces behind metal extraction in polymer-salt ATPS, providing valuable insights for optimizing extraction processes and paving the way for future research in this field.",

In this computational work, in order to deepen the mechanism of this chemoselective conjugation, we study the ligand exchange reaction between [Cp*Rh(H2O)3]2+ and three small molecules, namely p-cresol, 3-methylimidazole, and toluene, selected as mimetic of aromatic side chains of tyrosine (Tyr), tryptophan (Trp) and phenylalanine (Phe), respectively. Our outcomes suggest that the high selectivity for Tyr side chain might be related to OH group able to affect both thermodynamic and kinetic of ligand exchange reaction, due to its ability to act as both H bond acceptor and donor. These mechanistic aspects can be used to design new metal drugs containing the [Cp*Rh]2+ scaffold targeting specifically Tyr residues involved in biological/pathological processes such as phosphorylation by means of Tyr-kinase enzyme and protein–protein interactions.",

Here, a temperature-sensitive copolymer layer, P(NIPAM-co-DMAA), has been grafted in situ on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles using two monomers, N-isopropylacrylamide and N,N-dimethylacrylamide, by a single-electron-transfer living radical polymerization method. In this way, magneto-thermal dual-responsive temperature-sensitive copolymer/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles, Fe3O4@SiO2@P(NIPAM-co-DMAA), whave been successfully prepared. The lowest critical solution temperature (LCST) of P(NIPAM-co-DMAA) could be regulated between 39 and 58 °C by modulating the ratio of monomers, endowing Fe3O4@SiO2@P(NIPAM-co-DMAA) nanoparticles with a broader response temperature range for use in more applications. We have used density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulation to thoroughly study the LCST transition behavior of the temperature-sensitive copolymer P(NIPAM-co-DMAA) in water. The intelligent Pickering emulsion obtained by using Fe3O4@SiO2@P(NIPAM-co-DMAA) as a solid particle emulsifier can be regulated between “on” (emulsification) and “off” (breakage) states using temperature and magnetic field as trigger switches. A magnetic field allows the samples to be recycled and reused, which is in line with the energy saving concept. Therefore, the present research may find promising applications in enhanced oil recovery, and other industrial fields, and provides useful insight into the LCST transition behavior of temperature-sensitive polymers.",

These cycloaddition reactions were investigated using quasi-classical trajectory (QCT), classical molecular dynamics (MD), ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) simulations, and supervised machine-learning binary classification techniques. Room-temperature dynamics simulations started from the ambimodal transition state (TS) using the QCT, classical MD, and RPMD methods presented similar dynamics. Binary classification revealed that the initial geometry displacement from the ambimodal TS for the Diels–Alder cycloaddition of cyclopentadiene and nitroethene contributed to the branching dynamics and that the initial momenta for the intramolecular cycloaddition between a diene and triene and the Diels–Alder cycloaddition of 2-hydroxyacrolein with 1,3-butadiene played a significant role in the bifurcation dynamics.",

In order to find the lowest energy geometries, binding energies, stabilities of the complexes, and electrical characteristics, we applied the semiempirical tight binding framework, as implemented in the xTB software. Our simulations demonstrate that heavy metal nanoclusters favorably connect to both boron-nitride nanobelts, but the Möbius-type nanobelt exhibits a stronger connection. According to the calculations, the nickel nanocluster, which is followed by the cadmium and lead nanoclusters, has the lowest binding energy and the largest charge transfer with the nanobelts. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all complexes were stable at 298 K throughout the simulation period. The frontier orbitals follow the symmetry of the nanobelt and are uniformly distributed in the whole structure. When the nanobelt was twisted to form the Möbius-type nanobelt, this distribution was altered. The Möbius-type nanobelt created more bonds with the nickel nanocluster than with the cadmium or lead metals, according to the topological analysis, which also showed that the number of bonds between them doubled. By combining all the results, we found that the cadmium and lead nanoclusters were physisorbed in one nanobelt while the nickel nanoclusters were chemisorbed.",

Furthermore, the results also show that these systems are kinetically stable, having a very high energy barrier for Ng release, and their structures persist without major modifications throughout molecular dynamics simulations. Chemical interactions between Ngs and Si20X20 systems (X = H, F, Cl, Br and I) have been analyzed, results indicate that interactions are mainly non-covalent, showing a slight charge donation from the noble gas to the cage. Finally, it was found that for lighter Ngs, the repulsive interactions with the cage are lower than for the heavier ones, which accounts for their thermodynamic stability at low temperatures.",

The extracted lapachol was oxidized and cyclized to obtain the compounds β-lapachone and nor-β-lapachone, and treatment with terephthalaldehyde led to the final products with ∼ 60% yield. The photophysical studies showed absorption maxima in the violet region (∼400 nm) and fluorescence emission maxima depending on the solvent, ranging from 430 to 575 nm with a relatively large positive solvatochromism, confirmed by the Lippert-Mataga plot. Theoretical calculations corroborate the experimental observations regarding the ICT mechanism. The imidazoles showed a selective response to bisulfite ion (HSO3−) over other common anions, displaying a large change in both fluorescence and absorption spectra immediately after the addition of bisulfite, proving their potential application in tracing the bisulfite in future biological systems. The binding capacity of the imidazoles with human or bovine serum albumin (HSA and BSA, respectively) is spontaneous, weak (102–103 M−1 range), and subdomains IIA (Site I) and IB (Site III) are the main binding regions for the imidazoles depending on the nature of the metabolite or drug previously complexed with the albumin structure. Overall, both albumins have the same capacity to interact with the imidazoles under study.",

Although C-A-S-H is considered a durable material, it’s susceptible to sulfate attack. To better understand this phenomenon, the atomic process of sulfate attack on C-A-S-H was studied using semi-empirical quantum chemical methods. The results showed that sulfate attacks can be broken down into several subprocesses: adsorption, vibration, and breaking. The underlying causes of these processes were revealed through electronic structures, in which the weak AlO bond and strong electronegativity are the main factors leading to Al-Si breaking. The Atom in Molecular theory revealed that the weak electron localization of the [AlO4] tetrahedron leads to a lower water-assisted bond dissociated energy for breaking the AlO bond (18.3KJ/mol) than the SiO bond (109.4KJ/mol). This study provides valuable insights into the sulfate attack on C-A-S-H and its implications for improving the durability of sustainable concrete.",

It is common wisdom that molecular dynamics simulations should obey physical laws and, hence, lots of effort is put into ensuring that molecular dynamics simulations are energy conserving. The emergence of machine learning (ML) potentials for MD leads to a growing realization that monitoring conservation of energy during simulations is of low utility because the dynamics is often unphysically dissociative. Other ML methods for MD are not based on a potential and provide only forces or trajectories which are reasonable but not necessarily energy-conserving. Here we propose to clearly distinguish between the simulation-energy and true-energy conservation and highlight that the simulations should focus on decreasing the degree of true-energy non-conservation. We introduce very simple, new criteria for evaluating the quality of molecular dynamics by estimating the degree of true-energy non-conservation and we demonstrate their practical utility on an example of infrared spectra simulations. These criteria are more important and intuitive than simply evaluating the quality of the ML potential energies and forces as is commonly done and can be applied universally, e.g., even for trajectories with unknown or discontinuous potential energy. Such an approach introduces new standards for evaluating MD by focusing on the true-energy conservation and can help in developing more accurate methods for simulating molecular and materials properties.",

The studied systems were LiTFSI and NaTFSI solutions in ethylene carbonate or fluoroethylene carbonate and the neat solvents. We focused on the structure of the electrolytes and on the manifestations of ion–solvent interactions in the vibrational spectra. The IR spectra were calculated from MD trajectories as Fourier transforms of the dipole moment. The results were compared to the data obtained from ab initio MD. The spectral shifts of the carbonyl stretching mode calculated from the GFN2-xTB simulations were in satisfactory agreement with the ab initio MD data and the experimental results for similar systems. The performance in the region of molecular ring vibrations was significantly worse. We also found some differences in structural data, suggesting that the GFN2-xTB overestimates interactions of Me ions with TFSI anions and Na+ binding to solvent molecules. We conclude that the GFN2-xTB method is an alternative worth considering for MD simulations of liquids, but it requires testing of its applicability for new systems.",

In this study, a compound foam stabilized by a quaternary mixture (alkyl amidoamine (amine), citric acid (acid), α–olefin sulfonate (AOS) and lauramidopropyl betaines (LAPB)) was firstly developed with the Waring blender method. The liquid unloading performance of this compound foam was then investigated to estimate its application potential under various condensate fraction, salinity and temperature conditions. At a condensate content range of 20 %–40 %, the amine/acid/AOS/LAPB foam is particularly effective in unloading the liquids. However, salinity was found to reduce the foaming efficiency (referred to as the ratio of the mass of the formed foam to that of the original liquid) and liquid unloading performance of the amine/acid/AOS/LAPB foam, which could be overcome through the addition of a chelator, namely nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium salt (NTA). Temperatures higher than 60 °C enhanced the performance of the amine/acid/AOS/LAPB foam. Synergistic effects within the quaternary mixture were confirmed by surface tension measurements, morphological observation, interaction energy calculation and the electrostatic potential analysis. The present results suggested that the amine/acid/AOS/LAPB mixture may be of use in relieving liquid loading of gas wells.",

Understanding of their conformation is of critical importance for rational design of urea-containing bioactive compounds. Whilst the conformational preferences of biaryl ureas have been extensively studied, very little attention has been paid to alkylated analogues. We carried out a systematic study of N-aryl (phenyl and pyridyl)-N′-cyclopentyl ureas with differing N-methylation patterns using Well Tempered Metadynamics at a semi-empirical level in implicit water (GBSA) using Well-Tempered Metadynamics to generate their conformational free-energy landscapes. Geometries and energetics of the most relevant configurations are further refined using DFT level of theory. Validation for the computation was obtained by synthesis of all 8 analogues followed by conformational studies by X-ray crystallography and NMR. These findings reveal that the methylation pattern significantly affects the conformational preference of the system. Most notably, N-phenyl-N′-cyclopentyl urea is shown to adopt both the trans–trans, and cis–trans conformations with equal energy and that the cis–trans conformation can be significantly stabilised by the presence of an internal hydrogen bond to the N′-hydrogen. This study will be of utility for the design of N-alkyl-N′-aryl ureas as drug candidates.",

In particular, experiments with nerve agents are limited by the high risks involved in their handling. Therefore, the possibility of studying fragmentation pathways by a theoretical approach is especially welcome. In this work, for the first time, O-2-methoxyethyl N- [bis(dimethylamino)methylidene]-P-methylphosphonamidate, an analog of the Novichok nerve agent A-242, was synthesized employing a one-pot microscale synthesis. Electron ionization (EI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra (MS) were measured to provide data for CWC verification purposes. Considering that ESI-MS/MS is a powerful method for analyzing non-volatile, highly polar, and very water-soluble compounds, such as degradation products of nerve agents, we extensively investigated for the first time the ESI-(collision-induced dissociation) CID fragmentation pathways of the selected molecule. For this purpose, molecular dynamics simulations using the Quantum Chemical Mass Spectrometry (QCxMS) method employing the semiempirical electronic structure method GFN2-xTB were compared with Triple Quadrupole electrospray ionization (ESI) experimental spectra in positive ion mode. The base peak of the EI spectrum for this molecule was found to be m/z 151, which strongly suggests a McLafferty +1 (ML+1) rearrangement involving the 2-methoxyethyl moiety. The formation of ion the m/z 106 in the ESI-CID spectrum, according to the simulations, results from the rearrangement involving a transfer of one dimethylamino group to the phosphorus atom, a mechanism that would be difficult to identify without employing theoretical methods.",

However, for some of the Schiff bases, the enhanced emission upon aggregation is derived from their parent aldehydes rather than the Schiff base molecule themselves due to the hydrolysis. The susceptibility to hydrolysis has thus limited the wide application of Schiff bases in aqueous media. In this work, a water-stable Schiff base fluorophore DBSFCN was synthesized in which the triphenylamine (TPA) electron donor and benzonitrile electron acceptor were joined together by the imine structure. The hydrolytic stability of DBSFCN was confirmed by structural and spectral analysis. Meanwhile, DBSFCN displayed significant fluorescence emission enhancement in a water/tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixture with high water content and relatively good fluorescence quantum yield at the solid state (0.48), which exhibited a typical AIEE feature. Based on the water stability and AIEE characteristic of DBSFCN, a quantitative method for the determination of water content and kinematic viscosity of the automobile brake fluid was established. In addition, DBSFCN was available in living cell imaging and reversible mechanofluorochromism.",

            "abstract": "Gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) force fields have shown excellent accuracy, data efficiency, and applicability for molecules with hundreds of atoms, but the employed global descriptor limits transferability to ensembles of molecules. Many-body expansions (MBEs) should provide a rigorous procedure for size-transferable GDML by training models on fundamental n-body interactions. We developed many-body GDML (mbGDML) force fields for water, acetonitrile, and methanol by training 1-, 2-, and 3-body models on only 1000 MP2/def2-TZVP calculations each. Our mbGDML force field includes intramolecular flexibility and intermolecular interactions, providing that the reference data adequately describe these effects. Energy and force predictions of clusters containing up to 20 molecules are within 0.38 kcal mol−1 per monomer and 0.06 kcal (mol Å)−1 per atom of reference supersystem calculations. This deviation partially arises from the restriction of the mbGDML model to 3-body interactions. GAP and SchNet in this MBE framework achieved similar accuracies but occasionally had abnormally high errors up to 17 kcal mol−1. NequIP trained on total energies and forces of trimers experienced much larger energy errors (at least 15 kcal mol−1) as the number of monomers increased—demonstrating the effectiveness of size transferability with MBEs. Given these approximations, our automated mbGDML training schemes also resulted in fair agreement with reference radial distribution functions (RDFs) of bulk solvents. These results highlight mbGDML's value for modeling explicitly solvated systems with quantum-mechanical accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Currently, nearly all high-efficiency organic photovoltaic devices use donor polymers based on the benzo-dithiophene (BDT) unit. To diversify the choices of building blocks for high-performance donor polymers, the use of benzo-difuran (BDF) units is explored, which can achieve reduced steric hindrance, stronger molecular packing, and tunable energy levels. In previous research, the performance of BDF-based devices lagged behind those of BDT-based devices. In this study, a high efficiency (18.4%) is achieved using a BDF-based polymer donor, which is the highest efficiency reported for BDF donor materials to date. The high efficiency is enabled by a donor polymer (D18-Fu) and the aid of a solid additive (2-chloronaphthalene), which is the isomer of the commonly used additive 1-chloronaphthalene. These results revealed the significant effect of 2-chloronaphthalene in optimizing the morphology and enhancing the device parameters. This work not only provides a new building block that can achieve an efficiency comparable to dominant BDT units but also proposes a new solid additive that can replace the widely used 1-chloronaphthalene additive.",

Additionally, we studied systems with 162, 216, and 648 carbon atoms were studied. Since, in large systems, the use of methodologies such as DFT can often be prohibitive, the GFN2-xTB method has been applied, whose wavefunction has been used to calculate the ELF. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time an ELF study has been carried out with large systems and this method. On the other hand, the kinetic stability has been evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures. The results show that the hollow carbon structures present aromatic character, leading to high thermodynamic and kinetic stability, making them good candidates for exploring diverse and interesting applications. Finally, it is demonstrated that GFN2-xTB imethod allows the successful study of large systems where the analysis using DFT or post-Hartree-Fock calculations would have a high computational cost.",

Here, we generated samples of selected gauche and s-trans 2,3-dibromobutadiene (DBB) by electrostatic deflection in a molecular beam and studied their reaction with Coulomb crystals of laser-cooled Ca+ ions in an ion trap. The rate coefficients for the total reaction were found to strongly depend on both the conformation of DBB and the electronic state of Ca+. In the (4p)2P1/2 and (3d)2D3/2 excited states of Ca+, the reaction is capture-limited and faster for the gauche conformer due to long-range ion–dipole interactions. In the (4s)2S1/2 ground state of Ca+, the reaction rate for s-trans DBB still conforms with the capture limit, while that for gauche DBB is strongly suppressed. The experimental observations were analysed with the help of adiabatic capture theory, ab initio calculations and reactive molecular dynamics simulations on a machine-learned full-dimensional potential energy surface of the system. The theory yields near-quantitative agreement for s-trans-DBB, but overestimates the reactivity of the gauche-conformer compared to the experiment. The present study points to the important role of molecular geometry even in strongly reactive exothermic systems and illustrates striking differences in the reactivity of individual conformers in gas-phase ion–molecule reactions.",

            "abstract": "Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H-bond) donors to capture anions such as halides. In this work, the nature and selectivity of confined hydrogen bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block-localized wavefunction method (BLW-ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the intrinsic strengths of inward hydrogen bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH hydrogen bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction, respectively. Typical conformers of cages are classified into two groups, including the C3(h)-symmetrical conformers, in which all halide anions are located near the centroids of cages, and the “semi-open” conformers, which exhibit shifted bonding sites for different halide anions. Accordingly, the difference in governing factors of selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the C3 conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the C3(h)-symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike C3 conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi-open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F− to I−, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi-open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi-open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.",

It is necessary to clarify their electrical stability and decomposition mechanisms. In this work, we first introduced our experimental results for decomposition products of C4F7N/CO2 and C5F10O/synthetic air mixtures under partial discharge and spark discharge conditions. Then, we performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations on the typical decomposition products. The simulations were performed under standard electron impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS); thus, the statistical results of the mass spectra were compared with those of the experimentally obtained standard mass spectra from the NIST database. The AIMD simulation method in simulating the electron-induced ionization process was verified and found to be reliable. Finally, the calculations were also performed for C4F7N and C5F10O with incident electron energies of 20 eV and 70 eV, respectively. The dominant pathway for both gases is the formation of CF3+ with the fracture of the C–C bond. The AIMD simulation is able to predict the decomposition channels after electron-impact ionization without any preconceived knowledge of fragmentation pathways, which provides a novel insight into understanding the decomposition mechanisms of C4F7N and C5F10O under different discharge conditions with different energies.",

            "abstract": "Cluster fragmentation subjected to a high-voltage electric field may play an important role in controlling the novel ionic liquid (IL) electrospray propulsion but has received little attention. In this work, the micro-fragmentation mechanisms of three kinds of IL clusters are numerically investigated using both static and dynamic approaches based on the quantum mechanical principles. Firstly, it reveals that the Coulomb interaction dominates the total inter-fragment energy for all three IL dimers, whereas the hydrogen-bonding interaction is identified as the main cause for the much slower break-up rate of the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM-BF4]) dimer. In addition to the electrostatic interaction, the van der Waals interaction is a secondary energy component to which only a small fraction of atoms contribute significantly, regardless of IL cluster type. We find, only when the applied electric field is larger than 1 V/nm, the total inter-fragment energies of all three IL clusters start to dramatically reduced, indicating the possible occurrence of massive break-up. Secondly, ab initio molecular dynamics simulation further confirms that the [EMIM-BF4] negatively charged dimer is the most stable of three IL clusters under the identical conditions. As far as the high-voltage electric field is concerned, the one-parameter exponential function of break-up ratio versus time, routinely used in the field-free region, is not valid. Finally, on the basis of simulated results, a compound exponential-decay model is proposed, and the derived differential-sum equations from constant electric fields can be further applied to the non-uniform electric field.",

Solution 1H NMR studies show that this diazide undergoes self-assembly with divalent transition metal ions to form ML2 complexes with pendant azide groups, apparently suitable for conversion into metal-templated catenanes; however attempts to form these catenanes were unsuccessful. Instead a new macrocycle containing two btp motifs was prepared, which forms a nanotube structure in the solid state. Reduction of the azide groups to amines followed by amide bond formation was used to convert 1 into macrocycle 8 containing btp and isophthalamide functionalities. This macrocycle binds halide and oxalate anions in acetonitrile solely through the isophthalamide motif, and binds aromatic dicarboxylates very strongly through both the isophthalamide amide donors and the btp triazole donors. The macrocycle was complexed with Pd(II) and the resulting complexes were shown to bind strongly to halide anions. The solid state structures of [Pd·8·X]BF4 (X = Cl−, Br−, I−) were investigated by X-ray crystallography, which showed that [Pd·8·Br] forms an unusual “chain of dimers” structure assembled by metal complexation, N–H⋯Br− hydrogen bonding and short Pd⋯Pd contacts.",

Previously reported self-healable batteries mostly possess limited stretchability and rely on healable electrodes or electrolytes rather than achieving full-device self-healability. Herein, an all-component self-bonding strategy is reported to obtain an all-eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full-cell autonomous self-healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (>1000% areal strain) over a broad temperature range (−20 60 °C). Without requiring any external stimulus, the five-layered soft battery can efficiently recover both its mechanical and electrochemical performance at full-cell level. The developed AESB can be easily configured into various 3D architectures with highly interfacial compatible eutectogel electrodes, electrolyte, and substrate, presenting an excellent opportunity for the development of embodied energy technologies. The present work provides a general and user-friendly soft electronic material platform for fabricating a variety of intrinsic self-healing stretchable multi-layered electronics, which are promising beyond the field of energy storage, such as displays, sensors, circuits, and soft robots.",

These high-throughput predictions in turn enable a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to de novo design a series of cap-shaped ligand molecules with large binding affinities and boosting guest residence times by up to 7 orders of magnitude. Notably, halogenated aromatic compounds emerge as top-ranking ligands. Detailed modeling suggests the presence of halogen-bonding between the ligands and the CB7 portal. Meanwhile, the binding of top-ranked ligands is supported by 1H NMR and 2D DOSY-NMR. Our findings open up possibilities in gating of molecular transport through a nanoscale cavity with potential applications in nanopore technology and controlled drug release.",

            "abstract": "Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are ideal for large-scale, long-duration energy storage applications. However, the limited solubility of most ions and compounds in aqueous and non-aqueous solvents (1M–1.5 M) restricts their use in the days-energy storage scenario, which necessitates a large volume of solution in the numerous tanks and the vast floorspace for these tanks, making the RFB systems costly. To resolve the low energy storage density issue, this work presents a novel way in which the reactants and products are stored in both solid and soluble forms and only the liquid with soluble ions is circulated through the batteries. Storing the active ions in solid form can greatly increase the storage energy density of the system. With a solid to liquid storage ratio of 2:1, for example, the energy density of the electrolyte of vanadium sulfate (VOSO4), an active compound used in the all-vanadium RFB, can be increased from 40 Ah l−1 to 163 Ah l−1 (>4X), allowing an existing 6-h RFB system to become a 24-h system with minimal modifications. To show how the concept works, an H2-V flow battery with a solid/liquid storage system is used, and its successful demonstration validates the solid-liquid storage concept. The hybrid system stores reactants as soluble ions and undissolved solid. Only aqueous solution is circulated through the flow battery. The storage system enables the day-length storage with existing storage facilities. The dissolution/precipitation mechanism of V(IV) sulphate was investigated. A H2-V flow battery with the hybrid storage system was demonstrated.",

The latter compound is indicated by the analogy to the coordination chemistry of gold with halide ligands, as well as isoelectronic main-group compounds. Static and dynamic simulations at density-functional and semi-empirical level including effects of solvent and counter ions indicate that the square-planar II4− indeed represents a well-defined local minimum on the pentaiodide potential energy surface, albeit less stable than the typically observed V-shaped I5−. No simple pathway of transformation between the two forms of the pentaiodide ion can be identified. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the presence of cations, unavoidable during the synthesis of polyiodide compounds, may trigger decomposition of the II4− coordination complex into smaller polyiodide building blocks and thus constitute the main reason why this conformer so far has not been identified in solid polyiodide compounds. However, its intrinsic stability indicates that the square-planar form should be possible to isolate in solid compounds given the right conditions of synthesis.",

This strategy means that importing a large steric hindrance group diphenylmethane (DPM) decreases the torsion angles (θ) between the donor {triphenylamine (TPA)} and acceptor {9-H-thioxanthen-9-one-10,10-dioxide (TXO)} units, as well as between the donor (TPA) and π-bridge (benzene) fragments. The decrease of θ can accelerate the intramolecular charge transfer and enhance the contributions of the TPA, TXO and quinoxaline-6,7-dicarbo-nitrile (QCN) fragments to the axial component of the β0 value, and then the β0 values of TPA–TXO (β0 = 10 762 au) and TPA–QCN (β0 = 22 495 au) are increased by 14.9% and 34.4%, respectively. Overall, the intramolecular-locked strategy is very effective for designing high performance NLO materials.",

However, it is challenging to design materials with suitably narrow pores for KQS that also show good adsorption capacities and operate at practical temperatures. Here, we investigate a metal–organic cage (MOC) assembled from organic macrocycles and ZnII ions that exhibits narrow windows (<3.0 Å). Two polymorphs, referred to as 2α and 2β, were observed. Both polymorphs exhibit D2/H2 selectivity in the temperature range 30–100 K. At higher temperature (77 K), the D2 adsorption capacity of 2β increases to about 2.7 times that of 2α, along with a reasonable D2/H2 selectivity. Gas sorption analysis and thermal desorption spectroscopy suggest a gate-opening effect of the MOCs pore aperture. This promotes KQS at temperatures above liquid nitrogen temperature, indicating that MOCs hold promise for hydrogen isotope separation in real industrial environments.",

            "abstract": "Lithium–sulfur batteries have been considered one of the most promising energy storage devices because of their high energy density (2600 W·h·kg−1), low cost, and the environmental friendliness of sulfur. However, the shuttle effect caused by the soluble polysulfide produced by the sulfur cathode in the redox process seriously affects the commercialization of the battery. To solve such problems, we designed and synthesized a lightweight covalent organic framework (COF)–based TpPa–SO3H@PP separator through in situ interfacial polymerization. Benefiting from the lithiophilic –SO3H groups, which are arranged in the nanochannels of the TpPa–SO3H COF, the TpPa–SO3H@PP separator not only suppresses the shuttle of polysulfide but also facilitates Li+ migration. Moreover, the good wettability of the electrolyte to the TpPa–SO3H@PP separator resulted in a lower interfacial resistance and higher ionic conductivity, ensuring a higher energy density. Based on the above advantages, cells with the TpPa–SO3H@PP separator showed an initial specific capacity of 863.97 mAh g−1 at 1C, and a capacity of 645.62 mAh g−1 after 500 cycles, and the average capacity decay rate of each cycle was only 0.05%, indicating superior cycling performance. Significantly, we extended the in situ interfacial polymerization to the preparation of a lithiophilic amorphous porous organic polymer (POP)–based TpPa–COOH@PP separator, which also has good performance, demonstrating the universality and effectiveness of in situ interfacial polymerization. This work opens a new route to prepare lithiophilic COF@PP and POP@PP separators with a lower shuttle effect and higher ion transport via in situ interfacial polymerization for high–performance Li–S batteries.",

The morphology and dispersibility of the organic amine in the pore structure of the support can strongly affect the adsorption rate and stability of CO2. In this work, we propose a strategy that enhances the dispersion and stability of tetraethylene pentamine (TEPA) via anchoring TEPA with single site Ni(II) in the pore of the commercial mesoporous silica gel (SG). The microscopic morphology and dynamic behavior of TEPA molecules in the adsorbents preparation process were explored by molecular dynamics simulation, which proved that the dispersibility of anchored TEPA in the porous structure has been improved, resulting in enhanced mass transfer and increased kinetic adsorption rate. The anchored Ni-TEPA/SG adsorbents exhibit a 37.5% faster kinetic adsorption rate than TEPA/SG adsorbents at 30 wt% TEPA loading, and the time required to reach 90% of maximum adsorption capacity is shortened by 6 times. Besides, the CO2 adsorption performance of the optimized Ni-TEPA/SG adsorbent remains unchanged after 20 cycles, consolidating the potential of our proposed strategy in improving the kinetic adsorption rate and cyclic stability of solid amine adsorbents as well as promoting its industrialization.",

Also, these cationic analogues revealed strong and highly selective charge-dependent stabilization of AT-DNA against thermal denaturation, the calix[6]arene trication being an order of magnitude more efficient than its calix[4]arene dicationic analogue. At variance to DNA/RNA selectivity for only cationic calixarenes, both neutral and cationic calixarenes bind nucleoside monophosphates with similar efficiency, by forming tweezer-like supramolecular complexes, with nucleobases inserted between aromatic pendant arms grafted to calixarene rims. Such nucleotide-calixarene complexes were monitored by an emission change of calixarene as a function of nucleobase insertion, at variance to DNA/RNA complexes in which calixarene is inserted into the polynucleotide groove, which does not change calixarene emission – stressing the importance of the ligand insertion within a calix-basket for fluorimetric sensing.",

Structural frameworks of well-known imidazolium, pyridinium and cholinium ionic liquids (ILs) were combined with naturally occurring cinnamic acid (CA), which is known to possess a wide spectrum of biological activity. Different combinations of these two structural elements (IL and Cin (cinnamic moiety)) allowed modulating the solubility, physicochemical properties and biological activity of the resulting molecules. A significant increase in the biological activity was achieved for the three studied hybrid molecules - [C4mim-Cin][Cl], [C4py–Cin][Cl], and [C4mim-Cin][Cin]. Multiparameter cytotoxicity mapping was performed to visualize the biological activity of the 28 studied molecules. Detailed experimental investigation and molecular dynamics simulation were performed to gain insight into the structure–activity relationship. Of note, a folding conformational change in the structure of [Cnmim-Cin][Cl] hybrid molecules in solution resulted in a substantial change in chemical reactivity, with the activation energy of the hydrolysis reaction decreasing from 32.1 to 23.9 kcal/mol.",

Benznidazole (BZN) is the drug used to treat the disease. However, it has limited efficacy and adverse side effects. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic alternatives is necessary. In this work, the trypanocidal activity and cytotoxicity of a series of catechol-containing 3-arylcoumarins, their combination with BZN, and the inclusion in β-cyclodextrins (β-CDs), were evaluated. The results obtained showed that the entire series has moderate trypanocidal activity on the trypomastigote form of the parasite, being the 3-(4′-bromophenyl)-6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (8) the most active compound (IC50 = 34 μM) and the most cytotoxic in Vero cells (IC50 = 162 μM) as well. By forming the inclusion complex 8-β-CDs, the trypanocidal activity and cytotoxicity decreased. In addition, the formation of inclusion complexes increased the solubility. The possible mechanism of action of 8 was evaluated and proved to be through the generation of oxidative stress. The combination with BZN presented a synergistic effect on the trypanocidal activity, reducing the necessary dose of BZN. The presence of a catechol in the studied scaffold seems to modulate the trypanocidal activity, and the combination of drugs proved to be a promising alternative strategy for treating the disease.",

However, the poor reversibility caused by the decomposition obstacles of Li2CO3 and C products is still a challenge for Li-CO2 batteries, which seriously influences its electrochemical performances. Herein, a free-standing MnOOH arrays cathode has been prepared and employed in Li-CO2 battery, which realizes a great improvement of electrochemical performances by adjusting the discharge products distribution. Experiments coupled with theoretical calculations verifies that the formation of Li-containing carbonaceous species (LiCO2, LiCO and Li2CO3) bonded with MnOOH through Li ion regulates the nucleation behavior of Li2CO3 and C, making them grown on MnOOH uniformly. The fine Li2CO3 grains (with a size about 5 nm) embedded into carbon matrix greatly enlarges the contact interface between them, facilitating the transmission of electrons through the discharge products and finally improves CO2 evolution activity. This ingenious design strategy of regulating discharge products distribution to improve electrochemical performances provides a promising way to develop advanced Li-CO2 batteries.",

Trial-and-error approaches for mechanistic research at the molecular level are extremely difficult and resource intensive. Here we have revealed that the intra-molecular interactions of lignin aromatic rings were the internal force driving the aggregation of lignin into LNPs by combining molecular simulation with experimental methods. A quantitative aromatic interaction correlated with the configuration distribution of lignin dimer and LNP yields was also developed for guiding the synthesis and functionalization of LNPs. A cellulose-derived solvent, γ-valerolactone (GVL), was then screened out to sustain lignin molecules’ intramolecular stacking (−5.54 kJ mol−1) into a spherical nucleus for the growth of a uniform and stable lignin nanosphere during solvent shifting. With the assistance of the LNP formation mechanism, lignin could successfully stabilize in situ generated gold nanoparticles with excellent photothermal performance during the production of LNPs in a GVL/water solution. The newly proposed mechanism will provide an important theoretical basis for upgrading lignin to value-added biomaterials in a green and facile pathway.",

The complexes and H3L ligand were formed using an one-pot strategy and characterized by spectroscopy techniques (FT-IR and UV–Vis), X-ray diffraction and theoretical calculations. The crystal structure revealed that both compounds feature a [M2Cl2] core and two ligand enantiomers, namely 8S,6R,1R-H3L and 8R,6S,1S-H3L in each molecular unit. Absorption spectroscopy supported by DFT studies indicated that the H3L pyridine moiety plays a key role to the charge transfer observed in 1 and 2. Finally, a time-dependent change in the absorption spectra profiles of 1 and 2 was seen in stability studies in aqueous solutions, which was associated to the ligand replacement reactions and/or changes in coordination geometry. Molecular dynamics confirmed that aqueous solutions of both compounds are quickly undergoing a symmetrical breakdown of the former binuclear core, leading to mononuclear units. For 1, this process goes towards the H3L release, while 2 remains as a mononuclear H3L-containing species in penta- and hexacoordinate forms.",

            "abstract": "Glyphosate, the active ingredient in several broad-spectrum herbicide formulations, has been validated and widely used throughout the world. Recent reports have questioned its safety, showing that glyphosate may act as an endocrine disruptor by promoting estrogenic activity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in this phenomenon remains unclear. Therefore, here we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which glyphosate induces estrogenic activity using estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cell line models. Our results show that glyphosate mimics the cell effects of 17β-estradiol (E2), promoting estrogen receptor α (ERα) phosphorylation, its degradation, and transcriptional activity at high concentrations. The molecular mechanism seems involved in the ERα ligand-binding domain (LBD). Molecular simulations suggest a plausible interaction between glyphosate and the LBD through a coordinated complex involving divalent cations such as Zn (II). In addition, glyphosate exposure alters the level of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 that contribute to ERα phosphorylation. Finally, glyphosate at high concentrations increases the cell proliferation rate and levels of cell cycle regulators, accompanied by an increase in anchorage-independent growth capacity. These findings suggest that glyphosate at high concentrations, induces estrogen-like effects through an ERα ligand binding site-dependent mechanism, leading to cellular responses resulting from a complex interplay of genomic and non-genomic events.",

Results showed that as low as 40 ppm concentration of the freeze dried extract is sufficient to exhibit 98.6% corrosion inhibition at 323 K temperature. Polarization studies revealed that this extract acted as a mixed type inhibitor. Adsorption isotherm investigation suggested that the adsorption process followed Langmuir isotherm. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that both of physical and chemical adsorption are responsible for the overall adsorption process where the free energies of adsorption varied from − 30.42 to − 36.66 kJ mol−1 depending on temperature. Gas chromatography along with FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of carbohydrate molecules as major chemical constituents of the freeze dried leaf extract. d-Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide followed by l-arabinose, d-galactose, and d-mannose. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study established the existence of protective adsorbed film of inhibitor molecules over the metal surface. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to correlate the adsorption behavior with molecular structure of the inhibitor in terms of global molecular parameters like fractional electron charge transfer, dipole moment, energies of HOMO and LUMO. Molecular dynamic simulation studies followed by DFT calculations with ten explicit water molecules were performed using IEFPCM/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory to simulate water environment around the monosaccharide units. A plausible mechanism for inhibition properties was proposed on the basis of experimental and theoretical studies.",

Non-covalent interactions involving aromatic moieties are particularly important in this realm, as recurring motifs in biomolecular aggregation. In this work, we use high-resolution broadband rotational spectroscopy to probe the dynamic conformational landscape enclosing the self-pairing topologies of styrene oxide, a chiral aromatic system. We reach a definite assignment of four homochiral and two heterochiral dimers using auxiliary quantum chemistry calculations as well as structure-solving methods based on experimental isotopic information. A complete picture of the dimer conformational space is obtained, and plausible routes for conformational relaxation are derived. Molecular structures are discussed in terms of conformational flexibility, the concerted effort of weak intermolecular interactions, and their role in the expression of the molecular fit.",

The results show that they are highly active, and more so than the corresponding aluminium congeners. The catalyst system is applicable at low and elevated temperatures across a wide substrate scope including terminal, internal, multiple and fully deuterated epoxides. Applying low catalyst loadings has allowed for a TON of 344,000 to be obtained, highlighting their stability. A DFT investigation has confirmed that the gallium catalysts have lower energetic profiles compared to the aluminium congeners. Measurement of the Lewis acidity of both the gallium and aluminium aminotrisphenolate compounds using the Gutmann-Beckett method provides the experimental proof that the gallium compounds are more Lewis acidic than their aluminium congeners. Finally, Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamic (AIMD) simulations have investigated and quantified the dynamic behaviour of the catalytic systems, highlighting an important increase in fluxionality in some cases which helps to explain the increase in catalytic activity.",

The morphology and chemical composition of perfluoro octanoic acid–modified magnetic hyperbranched polyamideamine was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, zeta potential, particle size analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller measurement, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Perfluoro octanoic acid–modified magnetic hyperbranched polyamideamine was applied in magnetic solid phase extraction for the separation and enrichment of four fluorine-containing pesticides (indoxacarb, metaflumizone, cyflumetofen, and cyhalothrin). The magnetic solid phase extraction method based on perfluoro octanoic acid–modified magnetic hyperbranched polyamideamine has low method detection limits (0.30‒0.49 μg/L), a satisfactory coefficient of determination (0.9995‒0.9999), wide linear ranges (2.5‒250 μg/L), and good repeatability (intraday: 2.6‒4.7%; interday: 1.1‒7.9%). The enrichment factors and extraction efficiences varied from 55 to 76 and 69 to 96%, respectively. The sorbent-to-sorbent reproducibility was in the range of 3.2–7.6%, indicating that the synthesis of the sorbent was reliable. For the detection of actual water samples, the relative recoveries were in the range from 80.1 to 114.4% with relative standard deviations less than 9.6%. The calculation results of quantum chemistry calculations showed that after the modification of perfluoro octanoic acid, the interaction between the sorbent and four fluorine-containing pesticides was stronger.",

Unfortunately, it suffers from poor solubility and, to be used as a drug, an appropriate transport vehicle has to be developed, in order to optimize its release in the human tissues. As a possible drug-delivery system, β-cyclodextrin (βCD) represents a promising scaffold which can encapsulate the melatonin, releasing when needed. In this work, we present a computational study supported by experimental IR spectra on inclusion MT/βCD complexes.

However, its pollution by major human activities leading to clean water scarcity is a significant issue. Industrial activities release toxic pollutants, such as textile dyes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which pollute water resources and endanger the marine ecosystem and human life. To address this issue, we developed a highly effective sorbent platform based on a nanofibrous membrane, comprising hypercrosslinked cyclodextrin networks (HCNs). Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides with a truncated cone shape featuring a partially hydrophobic cavity interior, which can form complexes with organic micropollutants. The nanofibrous HCN membrane was produced via the electrospinning of highly concentrated CD solutions containing a naturally occurring graphitic acid linker. The thermal crosslinking of the nanofibrous membrane resulted in a robust covalent polymer network of CD macrocycles, which can retain its shape in aqueous and organic solvents. The membrane was produced by exclusively using green resources including a novel natural crosslinker (i.e., graphitic acid), which has not been previously employed for any CD-based materials. Molecular modeling revealed that the crosslinking had a negligible effect on the host–guest complexation of the nanofibrous CD networks. The HCN membrane was used for scavenging textile dyes and PAHs from polluted water, and it demonstrated high sorption performance (Qmax = 692 mg g−1 dye), and excellent reusability upon the application of acidic methanol treatment. The nanofibrous HCN membrane can be used for rapid and efficient scavenging of organic micropollutants in aqueous environments.",

In contrast to the well-known radiation-induced graft polymerization (RIGP), RIGI can use non-vinyl compounds such as small and large functional molecules, hydrophilic polymers, or even enzymes. In a one-step electron-beam-based process, immobilization can be performed in a clean, fast, and continuous operation mode, as required for industrial applications. This study proposes a reaction mechanism using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and two small model molecules, glycine and taurine, in aqueous solution. Covalent coupling of single molecules is achieved by radical recombination and alkene addition reactions, with water radiolysis playing a crucial role in the formation of reactive solute species. Hydroxyl radicals contribute mainly to the immobilization, while solvated electrons and hydrogen radicals play a minor role. Release of fluoride is mainly induced by direct ionization of the polymer and supported by water. Hydrophobic chains attached to cations appear to enhance the covalent attachment of solutes to the polymer surface. Computational work is complemented by experimental studies, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and fluoride high-performance ion chromatography (HPIC).",

Upon light irradiation, these systems evolve from a coloured open-chain to a colourless closed-ring form, while the thermal back-reaction occurs at room temperature. In order to fulfill the requirements for different applications, new molecules with specific properties need to be designed. For instance, shifting the activation wavelength towards the red part of the visible spectrum is of relevance to biological applications. By using accurate computational calculations, we have designed new DASAs and predicted some of their photophysical properties. Starting from well-studied donor and acceptor parts, we have shown that small chemical modifications can lead to substantial changes in both photophysical and photoswitching properties of the resulting DASAs. Furthermore, we have also analysed how these substitutions impact the electronic structure of the systems. Finally, some pertinent candidates have been successfully synthesized and their photoswitching properties have been characterized experimentally.",

While steric repulsion has been regarded as the key director of the observed high enantioselectivity for many years, we show that London dispersion (LD) interactions are at least as important for enantiodiscrimination. We exemplify this through a combination of detailed computational and experimental studies for a series of modified CBS catalysts equipped with dispersion energy donors (DEDs) in the catalysts and the substrates. Our results demonstrate that attractive LD interactions between the catalyst and the substrate, rather than steric repulsion, determine the selectivity. As a key outcome of our study, we were able to improve the catalyst design for some challenging CBS reductions.",

This motivates the development of efficient synthetic methods aiming to predicatively and precisely tailor the MWD. In this work, 2-bromomaleimide (MBr) was used as a monomeric retarder to hinder the chain growth in the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA), resulting in the broadening of the MWD of PMMA with a high dispersity (Đ). Đ could be well tuned between 1.2 and 2.0 by changing the feed ratio of the initial concentration of MBr to the chain transfer agent (CTA). To further control the MW and Đ, furan-protected MBr (FMBr), referred to as a latent monomeric retarder, was used to manipulate the release of MBr via a retro-Diels–Alder reaction at an elevated temperature. As FMBr remained intact at a low temperature (40 °C) while it underwent deprotection at a high temperature (110 °C), the onset of MBr release could be well controlled by temperature programming to fine-tune the MWD. The concept of a latent monomeric retarder introduced a simple and non-invasive way to finely adjust the MW and Đ, advancing the methodology research on MWD control.",

The adopted NE alchemy combines enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations with driven fast out-of-equilibrium alchemical trajectories to recover the free energy via the Jarzynski and Crooks NE theorems. The GAFF2 non-polarizable force field was used for the parametrization. Performances were acceptable and similar in accuracy to those we submitted for Gibb’s Deep Cavity Cavitands in the previous SAMPL6 host-guest challenge, confirming the reliability of the computational approach and exposing, in some cases, some important deficiencies of the GAFF2 non-polarizable force field.",

Spectroscopically, transitions belonging to four low energy conformers were identified and their hyperfine patterns owing to the 14N quadrupolar nucleus were unambiguously resolved. The rotational spectrum of the global minimum geometry, conformer I, shows an additional splitting associated with a tunneling motion through an energy barrier interconnecting its enantiomeric forms. A two-step tunneling trajectory is proposed by finding transition state structures corresponding to the allyl torsion and NH inversion. Natural bond orbital and non-covalent interaction analyses reveal that an interplay between steric and hyperconjugative effects rules the conformational preferences of AMA.",

The approach was tested by reproducing the results of previous femtosecond studies on ethylene, naphthalene and new results for phenanthrene.",

            "abstract": "Acetaldehyde (AA) isomerization [to vinylalcohol (VA)] and decomposition (into either CO + CH4 or H2 + C2H2O) are studied using a fully dimensional, reactive potential energy surface represented as a neural network (NN). The NN, trained on 432 399 reference structures from MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations, has a mean absolute error of 0.0453 kcal/mol and a root mean squared error of 1.186 kcal mol−1 for a test set of 27 399 structures. For the isomerization process AA → VA, the minimum dynamical path implies that the C–H vibration and the C–C–H (with H being the transferring H-atom) and the C–C–O angles are involved to surmount the 68.2 kcal/mol barrier. Using an excess energy of 93.6 kcal/mol—the typical energy available in the solar spectrum and sufficient to excite to the first electronically excited state—to initialize the molecular dynamics, no isomerization to VA is observed on the 500 ns time scale. Only with excess energies of ∼127.6 kcal/mol (including the zero point energy of the AA molecule), isomerization occurs on the nanosecond time scale. Given that collisional quenching times under tropospheric conditions are ∼1 ns, it is concluded that formation of VA following photoexcitation of AA from actinic photons is unlikely. This also limits the relevance of this reaction pathway to be a source for formic acid.",

            "abstract": "The metallic lithium (Li) is considered as the most promising anode material for high-energy batteries. Nevertheless, the uncontrollable growth of Li dendrite and unstable electrolyte/electrode interface still hinder the development of Li-based battery. In this work, a novel strategy has been proposed to stabilize Li anode by in-situ polymerizing polypyrrole (PPy) layer on Ni foam (PPy@Ni foam) as an artificial protective layer. The PPy protective layer can effectively decrease the contact between Li metal and electrolyte during cycling. In addition, the morphology characterization shows that the PPy layer can help the even Li deposition underneath the layer, leading to a dendrite-free Li anode. As a result, when deposited 2 mAh•cm−2 Li metal, the PPy@Ni foam can keep stable Coulombic efficiency (99%) during nearly 250 cycles, much better than the pure Ni foam (100 cycles). Even in the case of the Li capacity of 10 mAh•cm−2, the stable cycling performance for 60 cycles can still be achieved. Furthermore, when assembled with LiFePO4 material as the cathode for a full cell, the PPy@Ni foam can keep high capacity retention of 85.5% at 500 cycles. In our work, we provide a simple and effective method to enhance the electrochemical performances of Li metal-based batteries, and reveal a new avenue to design three-dimensional (3D) metallic current collector for protecting the Li metal anode.",

            "abstract": "The ethanol electro-oxidation mechanism on a Pd(111) surface in alkaline media has been studied through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. It is known that, under these conditions, ethanol undergoes partial oxidation to acetate and that hydroxylation of the acetyl radical plays a fundamental role in the overall reaction kinetics. Therefore, we focused on this reaction step, specifically addressing the interplay of the acetyl and hydroxyl radicals and especially the effect of their arrangement over the Pd surface on the hydroxylation process. We observed that the strength of the interactions of the reacting species with the Pd surface significantly modulates the propensity of the reaction. In fact, for minimum-energy arrangements of the acetyl-surface and OH-surface systems, hydroxylation appears hindered by the strong interactions between the surface and substrates, while it readily takes place when the substrates are moved away from the surface. These results open to the idea of rational design of cocatalysts based on the tuning of surface chemical properties addressed to weaken the adsorbate/adsorbent interactions, eventually enhancing the exchange current density.",

            "abstract": "The observation of post-transition-state dynamic effects in the context of metal-based transformation is rare. To date, there has been no reported case of a dynamic effect for the widely employed class of palladium-mediated coupling reactions. We performed an experimental and computational study of the trifluoromethylation of Pd(II)F, which is a key step in the Pd(0)/Pd(II)-catalyzed trifluoromethylation of aryl halides or acid fluorides. Our experiments show that the cis/trans speciation of the formed Pd(II)CF3 is highly solvent- and transmetalation reagent-dependent. We employed GFN2-xTB- and B3LYP-D3-based molecular dynamics trajectory calculations (with and without explicit solvation) along with high-level QM calculations and found that depending on the medium, different transmetalation mechanisms appear to be operative. A statistically representative number of Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggest that in benzene, a difluorocarbene is generated in the transmetalation with R3SiCF3, which subsequently recombines with the Pd via two distinct pathways, leading to either the cis- or trans-Pd(II)CF3. Conversely, GFN2-xTB simulations in MeCN suggest that in polar/coordinating solvents an ion-pair mechanism is dominant. A CF3 anion is initially liberated and then rebinds with the Pd(II) cation to give a cis- or trans-Pd(II). In both scenarios, a single transmetalation transition state gives rise to both cis- and trans-species directly, owing to bifurcation after the transition state. The potential subsequent cis- to trans isomerization of the Pd(II)CF3 was also studied and found to be strongly inhibited by free phosphine, which in turn was experimentally identified to be liberated through displacement by a polar/coordinating solvent from the cis-Pd(II)CF3 complex. The simulations also revealed how the variation of the Pd-coordination sphere results in divergent product selectivities.",

This scale is otherwise barely reachable with classical force-field methods or novel neural network and machine learning potentials. We achieve this breakthrough by combining innovations in linear-scaling AIMD, efficient and approximate sparse linear algebra, low and mixed-precision floating-point computation on GPUs, and a compensation scheme for the errors introduced by numerical approximations. The core of our work is the non-orthogonalized local submatrix method (NOLSM), which scales very favorably to massively parallel computing systems and translates large sparse matrix operations into highly parallel, dense matrix operations that are ideally suited to hardware accelerators. We demonstrate that the NOLSM method, which is at the center point of each AIMD step, is able to achieve a sustained performance of 324 PFLOP/s in mixed FP16/FP32 precision corresponding to an efficiency of 67.7% when running on 1536 NVIDIA A100 GPUs.",

We selected solutions of CuCl, PdCl2, and the CuCl–PdCl2 mixture as models of popular precatalysts in cross-coupling reactions and the Wacker process that can form “cocktail”-type systems. The spectra exhibited a great number of signals of mono- and bimetallic oligomeric chloride subnanoclusters. Few oligometallic ions had core–shell structures, according to the computations; the structure of most ions was completely unsymmetric, with bridging Cl− ligands supporting the oligomeric structures. Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics showed that some ions were structurally flexible under the selected conditions. Many considered ions exhibited rich configurational and conformational isomerism. The activation (polarization) of the N2 molecule (from the drying gas used during electrospray ionization) by some ions was determined by the analysis of electron density distributions. For the first time, we describe a flexible approach for semiautomatic analysis of highly complex mass-spectra of organometallic systems in solution with the possibility of revealing molecular structures.",

PAHs are a family of molecules ubiquitous in space and involved in much of the chemistry of the interstellar medium. In our experiments, ions are formed by interaction with 30.3 nm extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photons, and their velocity map images are recorded using a PImMS2 multi-mass imaging sensor. Application of recoil-frame covariance analysis allows the total kinetic energy release (TKER) associated with multiple fragmentation channels to be determined to high precision, ranging 1.94–2.60 eV and 2.95–5.29 eV for the dications and trications, respectively. Experimental measurements are supported by Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations.",

Here, we report how ring strain influences the rotation of a rotary molecular motor. Bridging the two halves of the motor with alkyl tethers of varying sizes yields macrocycles that constrain the motor's movement. Increasing the ring size by two methylene increments increases the mobility of the motor stepwise and allows for fine-tuning of strain in the system. Small macrocycles (8–14 methylene units) only undergo a photochemical E/Z isomerization. Larger macrocycles (16–22 methylene units) can perform a full rotational cycle, but thermal helix inversion is strongly dependent on the ring size. This study provides systematic and quantitative insight into the behavior of molecular motors under a mechanical load, paving the way for the development of complex coupled nanomachinery.",

The infrared (IR) spectra of their main fragments are recorded by infrared multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD). Extended tight-binding (GFN2-xTB) based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in order to provide the missing structure information for this experiment and to identify fragmentation path ways. The pathways for fragmentation were further investigated at a hybrid density functional theory (DFT) and dispersion-corrected level.<i><b>Results.<b/><i/> A strong signal for loss of 28 mass units of [<i>py<i/> + 7<i>H<i/>]<sup>+<sup/> is observed both in the CID experiment and the MD simulation, while [<i>py<i/> + 5<i>H<i/>]<sup>+<sup/> shows a negligible signal for the product corresponding to a mass loss of 28. The 28 mass loss from [<i>py<i/> + 7<i>H<i/>]<sup>+<sup/> is assigned to the loss of ethylene (C<sub>2<sub/>H<sub>4<sub/>) and a good fit between the calculated and experimental IR spectrum of the resulting fragment species is obtained. Further DFT calculations show favorable kinetic pathways for loss of C<sub>2<sub/>H<sub>4<sub/> from hydrogenated PAH configurations involving three consecutive CH<sub>2<sub/> molecular entities.<i><b>Conclusions.<b/><i/> This joint experimental and theoretical investigation proposes a chemical pathway of ethylene formation from fragmentation of superhydrogenated PAHs. This pathway is sensitive to hydrogenated edges (e.g., the degree of hydrogenation and the hydrogenated positions). The inclusion of this pathway in astrochemical models may improve the estimated abundance of ethylene.",

This information is regularly used to interpret gas solubility and separation within ionic liquids (ILs). Here, we use several different quantum chemical and previous molecular dynamics simulation results to show that strong solute–solvent interactions neither lead to high solubility nor to high selectivity, with respect to other solutes. Instead, the solute–solvent interaction strength with different isolated IL ions is affected by the electrostatic extremes. Also, the solute–solvent interaction with different IL molecules is strongly correlated to the molecular volumes or polarizabilities (within a series of same-anion based ILs).",

The interpretation of the measurements has been assisted by multilevel atomistic simulations, based on semi-empirical tight-binding and DFT-based methods. Our protocol established a positive-feedback loop between experimental and computational techniques, which has enabled a sound and detailed atomistic description of such complex heterogeneous molecular aggregates. Among biomolecules, uracil offers interesting and generalized skeletal features; its structure encompasses an alternation of hydrophilic H-bond donor and acceptor sites and hydrophobic moieties, typical in biomolecular systems, that induces a supramolecular core–shell-like organization of the mixed clusters with a water core and an uracil shell. This structure is far from typical models of both solid-state hydration, with water molecules in defined positions, or liquid solvation, where disconnected uracil molecules are completely surrounded by water.",

The freshly prepared TPEPhCOOH film has the fluorescence (FL) at ca. 498 nm with the excited-state decay lifetime of 2.98 ns and the absolute luminescence quantum yield of 64.8%. The FL studies on the non-radiative TPEPhCOOH/THF solutions with different metal ions suggest that TPEPhCOOH could radiatively response to the presence of Zn2+ ions. The aggregation-induced emission character of TPEPhCOOH in the mixed water/THF solvent (ca. 10−5 mol/L), along with the molecular dynamic and the quantum mechanic calculations, suggests that the Zn2+ CISE of TPEPhCOOH should originate from the coordination between Zn2+ ions and the TPE moiety of TPEPhCOOH.",

            "abstract": "A new near-IR absorbing nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), MPU4, is synthesized in three steps from an accessible selenophene–diketopyrrolopyrrole and rhodanine. The high planarity of the molecule and the extended conjugation determine that the new NFA presents a high optical absorption coefficient and a narrow bandgap. In thin films, MPU4 shows broad absorption in the visible and near-IR regions from 550 to 930 nm. When blended with a phenothiazine-based small-molecule (SM) donor, SM1, the resulting additive-free binary organic solar cell (OSC) exhibits an efficiency of 8.96% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.99 V and a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 14.91 mA cm−2 with a remarkably low energy loss (Eloss) of 0.42 eV. This efficiency is significantly higher (24%) than that achieved with an analogous device with a thiophene-containing NFA (MPU1, 7.22%) instead of MPU4. Importantly, ternary solar cells prepared with SM1 as the donor and MPU4 and PC71BM as acceptors afford, after solvent vapor annealing, an efficiency of 10.04% with a Voc of 0.92 V, Jsc of 16.32 mA cm−2, fill factor of 0.67, and Eloss of 0.49 eV. These results demonstrate the advantages of using selenophene instead of thiophene in SM OSCs.",

This approach sheds light on the different molecular interactions (H-bond, π-stacking, dispersion interactions) at work in the cluster and provides a good understanding of the observed XPS chemical shifts with respect to the isolated molecule in terms of intramolecular and intermolecular screening occurring after the core–hole ionization. The proposed bottom-up approach, reasonably expensive in terms of computational resources, has been validated by finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations of clusters composed of up to fifty molecules.",

            "abstract": "The preparation of functionalized, heteroleptic PdxL2x coordination cages is desirable for catalytic and optoelectronic applications. Current rational design of these cages uses the angle between metal-binding (∠B) sites of the di(pyridyl)arene linker to predict the topology of homoleptic cages obtained via non-covalent chemistry. However, this model neglects the contributions of steric bulk between the pyridyl residues—a prerequisite for endohedrally functionalized cages, and fails to rationalize heteroleptic cages. We describe a classical mechanics (CM) approach to predict the topological outcomes of PdxL2x coordination cage formation with arbitrary linker combinations, accounting for the electronic effects of coordination and steric effects of linker structure. Initial validation of our CM method with reported homoleptic Pd12LFu24 (LFu = 2,5-bis(pyridyl)furan) assembly suggested the formation of a minor topology Pd15LFu30, identified experimentally by mass spectrometry. Application to heteroleptic cage systems employing mixtures of LFu (∠B = 127°) and its thiophene congener LTh (∠B = 149° ∠Bexp = 152.4°) enabled prediction of Pd12L24 and Pd24L48 coordination cages formation, reliably emulating experimental data. Finally, the topological outcome for exohedrally (LEx) and endohedrally (LEn) functionalized heteroleptic PdxL2x coordination cages were predicted to assess the effect of steric bulk on both topological outcomes and coordination cage yields, with comparisons drawn to experimental data.",
