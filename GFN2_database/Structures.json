            "abstract": "Solar energy conversion and storage are vital for combating climate change. Molecular solar thermal systems offer a promising solution, where energy is stored in molecular compounds. This study investigates dyad molecular photoswitches by combining bicyclooctadiene/tetracyclooctane and dihydroazulene/vinylheptafulvene systems with phenyl and cyano groups. Density functional theory calculations were employed to determine molecular properties and consider solvation effects in toluene and dichloromethane. The results show that the combined systems have a predicted storage energy of up to 206.14 kJ mol−1 and an absorption peak at 390.26 nm with appreciable intensity. These dyad photoswitches exhibit favorable properties for molecular solar thermal storage and other applications. A comparison with individual photoswitches reveals advantages and disadvantages. The most effective conjugate has a slightly lower storage density than an equal mixture of individual systems, but it demonstrates better absorption characteristics, with improved overlap with the solar spectrum and higher absorption intensity. These findings contribute to the understanding of dyad molecular photoswitches, showcasing their potential for advanced energy storage and conversion technologies.",

The formation of sequences under thermodynamic control using labile coordination bonds would be attractive for synthetic ease and modular capability, but this presents issues regarding sequence preservation. Here is presented an approach integrating palladium(II) metal ions into the sequence itself, with fidelity maintained through use of complementary pairings of ligand arrangements at the metal centre. This is accomplished using sites of different denticity and/or hydrogen bonding capability. In this fashion, discrete and ordered metallo-sequences are formed as thermodynamic products in a single step, and these then fold into defined conformations due to π–π interactions between electron-rich and -poor aromatic regions of the combined componentry.",

            "abstract": "A triple dynamic complex system has been designed, implementing a dynamic covalent process coupled to two supramolecular self-assembly steps. To this end, two dynamic covalent libraries (DCLs), DCL-1 and DCL-2, have been established on the basis of dynamic covalent C═C/C═N organo-metathesis between two Knoevenagel derivatives and two imines. Each DCL contains a barbituric acid-based Knoevenagel constituent that may undergo a sequential double self-organization process involving first the formation of hydrogen-bonded hexameric supramolecular macrocycles that subsequently undergo stacking to generate a supramolecular polymer SP yielding a viscous gel state. Both DCLs display selective self-organization-driven amplification of the constituent that leads to the SP. Dissociation of the SP on heating causes reversible randomization of the constituent distributions of the DCLs as a function of temperature. Furthermore, diverse distribution patterns of DCL-2 were induced by modulation of temperature and solvent composition. The present dynamic systems display remarkable self-organization-driven constitutional adaption and tunable composition by coupling between dynamic covalent component selection and two-stage supramolecular organization. In more general terms, they reveal dynamic adaptation by component selection in low Reynolds number conditions of living systems where frictional effects dominate inertial behavior.",

Rational design of new molecular materials with tailored properties is currently hampered by the difficulty in predicting how a candidate molecule will pack in space and how to control the particular polymorph obtained experimentally. Here, we develop a rapid screening approach to aid the material design process, which is then applied to predict the charge-transfer properties of 1344 helicene compounds that have potential as organic electronic materials. Our approach bridges the gap between single-molecule design, molecular assembly, and the resulting charge-carrier mobilities. We find that fluorination significantly improves electron transport in the molecular material by over 200%, while side groups containing triple bonds largely lead to improved transfer integrals. We validate our screening approach through the use of full crystal structure prediction for the most promising compounds to confirm the presence of favorable packing motifs that maximize charge mobility.",

Understanding the formation mechanisms and molecular structure of BrC is of key importance in developing strategies to control its environment and health impact. Structure determination of BrC is challenging, due to the lack of experiments providing molecular fingerprints and the sheer number of molecular candidates with identical mass. Suggestions based on chemical intuition are prone to errors due to the inherent bias. We present an unbiased algorithm, using graph-based molecule generation and machine learning, which can identify all molecular structures of compounds involved in biomass burning and the composition of BrC. We apply this algorithm to C12H12O7, a light-absorbing “test case” molecule identified in chamber experiments on the aqueous photo-oxidation of syringol, a prevalent marker in wood smoke. Of the 260 million molecular graphs, the algorithm leaves only 36,518 (0.01%) as viable candidates matching the spectrum. Although no unique molecular structure is obtained from only a chemical formula and a UV/vis absorption spectrum, we discuss further reduction strategies and their efficacy. With additional data, the method can potentially more rapidly identify isomers extracted from lab and field aerosol particles without introducing human bias.",

            "abstract": "Perylenediimide (PDI) compounds with no substituents in their core are widely used as the active units of thin-film organic lasers. Recently, bay-substituted PDIs (b-PDIs) bearing two sterically hindering diphenylphenoxy groups at the 1,7-bay positions have received great attention because they show red-shifted emission with respect to bay-unsubstituted PDIs, while maintaining high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and low amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) thresholds even at high doping rates. However, their ASE photostability is relatively low compared to that of state-of-the-art PDIs. Thus, the design of b-PDIs with improved ASE photostability remains a challenge. Here, the synthesis of two b-PDIs with phenyl-type substituents at the imide positions is reported. Complete characterization of their optical properties, including absorption, PL, ASE, and transient spectroscopy, supported also by quantum chemical calculations, is performed with the dyes diluted in either a liquid solvent or a polystyrene film. Film experiments were accomplished at very low doping rates, to resemble the isolated molecule behavior, and also in a range of increasing doping rates, to investigate concentration quenching effects. The reported b-PDIs show improved ASE photostability (3-fold) with respect to b-PDIs with aliphatic-type substituents at the imide positions, whilst they show more propensity toward aggregation.",

The presence of an iridium(III) ligand at the N-terminus of DADA allowed the use of the metalloenzyme as a catalyst in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of cyclic imines. In particular, the type of link between DADA and the metal-chelating moiety was found to be fundamental for inducing asymmetry in the reaction outcome, as highlighted by both computational studies and catalytic results. Using the [IrCp*(m-I)Cl]Cl ⊂ Van complex in 0.1 M CH3COONa buffer at pH 5, a significant 70% (S) e.e. was obtained in the reduction of quinaldine B.",

However, and in contrast to the more common planar discotics, the self-assembly of conic or pyramidic molecules in solution remains largely unexplored. Here, we show how a molecular geometry change, from flat to conic, can generate supramolecular landscapes where different self-assembled species, each of them being under thermodynamic equilibrium with the monomer, exist exclusively within distinct regimes. In particular, depending on the solvent nature–aromatic or aliphatic–cone-shaped C3-symmetric subphthalocyanine 1 can undergo self-assembly either as a tail-to-tail dimer, showing monomer–dimer sigmoidal transitions, or as a head-to-tail noncentrosymmetric columnar polymer, exhibiting a nucleation-elongation polymerization mechanism. Moreover, the experimental and theoretical comparison between racemic and enantiopure samples revealed that the two enantiomers (1M and 1P) tend to narcissistically self-sort in the dimer regime, each enantiomer showing a strong preference to associate with itself, but socially self-sort in the polymer regime, favoring an alternate stacking order along the columns.",

Herein, we developed a method to synthesize the type I porous liquids via liquefaction of cyclodextrins by chemical modification. The cyclodextrin porous liquids were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, NMR, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), circular dichroism (CD), and UV–vis spectroscopy. The measured ionic conductivity of the γ-cyclodextrin porous liquid was 500 times as great as that of its reactants, which was found to be the first instance with such great conductivity for a type I porous liquid. What is more, the γ-cyclodextrin porous liquid had been demonstrated experimentally to have outstanding chiral recognition ability toward pyrimidine nucleosides in water, which was further confirmed by computational simulations. Additionally, enantiomeric excess of the extracted nucleoside was achieved up to 84.81% by convenient extraction from the mixture of racemic nucleosides and γ-cyclodextrin porous liquid. The great features of the novel cyclodextrin porous liquids could bring opportunities in many fields, including the preparation of chiral separation materials, development of new drug screening mechanisms, and construction of chiral response materials.",

            "abstract": "Vitamin C (VC) is an essential antioxidant, but its application is limited because of its unstable chemical properties. Hence, a variety of VC derivatives have emerged in practical antioxidant applications. To explore the relationship between the antioxidant properties and the chemical structures of vitamin C and its derivatives, density functional theory (DFT) was used in this work to calculate the reaction enthalpies of the mechanisms related to radical scavenging activity. The structures were optimized at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G* level of theory. Single point calculations (SPE) were performed at the PWPB95-D3 (BJ)/def2-QZVPP level. To estimate the solvent effect on antioxidant properties, the SMD (solvation model based on density) method was used. The results showed that in the process of optimizing the chemical structure of vitamin C, the antioxidant capacity of its derivatives decreased slightly in aqueous solvents. In the calculation process, it is also found that in the choice of antioxidant mechanism, these compounds are more inclined to the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, and from the chemical structure point of view, the double bond of the lactone ring is essential for its free radical scavenging activity. In general, it is necessary to continue to optimize the structure of VC to obtain derivatives with better oxidation resistance and more practical value.",

The radical was isolated in the form of its σ-dimer, which was shown to possess a conformationally restricted two-layer structure both in the solid state and in solution. The dimer is cleaved into its parent radicals when exposed to ultraviolet or visible radiation in toluene solutions but is resistant to thermally induced dissociation. Under inert conditions, the radicals recombine quantitatively into the σ-dimer with observable kinetics, but they are oxidized into a ketone derivative in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. Combined structural, spectroscopic, and theoretical evidence shows that the σ-dimer contains a weak C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond, but is stabilized against thermal dissociation by a very strong dispersive interaction between the overlapping π surfaces.",

Among them, indeno[1,2b]fluorene and indeno[1,2c]fluorene isomers present a central p-quinodimethane unit leading to unique optical properties. In this work, we characterized the absorption spectra of indeno[1,2b]fluorene and [2,1-c]diindeno[n]thiophene derivatives with (spin-flip) simplified time-dependent density functional theory [(SF-)sTD-DFT] methods. Note that the SF-sTD-DFT level of theory allows a computationally efficient treatment for large diradicals. To interpret spectra, we implemented natural transition orbitals (NTOs) at both SF-sTD-DFT and sTD-DFT levels. This compact and method-independent representation of the electronic excitation provides a simple interpretation for the low-lying excited states of this set of molecules in terms of three different types of NTOs: “quinoid”, “aromatic”, and “π-bonded”. When comparing with experiment, we found that only one molecule of this set is actually a high-spin triplet diradical. Others are almost closed-shell molecules with a very small contribution from a doubly excited configuration that only the spin-flip method could capture. The small amount of static correlation recovered by the spin-flip active space provides a linear relation between the first visible theoretical and experimental excitation energies among this set.",

A detailed analysis of the reaction mechanisms in the gas phase and on the surface of mineral dust, represented by mono- and trisilicic acid, revealed that mineral dust has the potential of decreasing reaction barrier heights. Specifically, at 0 K, mineral dust can lower the apparent energy barrier of the reaction of formaldehyde with formic acid to zero. However, when the entropic contributions to the reaction free energies were accounted for, mineral dust was found to selectively enhance the reaction of water with formaldehyde, while inhibiting the reaction of formaldehyde and formic acid, in the lower parts of the troposphere (with temperatures around 298 K). In the upper troposphere (with temperatures closer to 198 K), mineral dust catalyzes both reactions and also the reaction of methanol with formic acid. Despite the intrinsic potential of mineral dust, calculation of the catalytic enhancement parameter for a likely range of dust aerosol concentrations suggested that dust aerosols will not contribute to secondary organic aerosol formation via dimerization of closed-shell organic compounds. The main reason for this is the relatively low absolute concentration of tropospheric dust aerosol and its inefficiency in increasing the effective reaction rate coefficients.",

            "abstract": "A complete series of experimental and theoretical investigations on the supramolecular polymerization of chiral (1 and 2) and achiral (3) oligo(phenylene ethynylene) tricarboxamides (OPE-TAs) is reported. The performance of seargents-and-soldiers (SaS) and majority rules (MR) experiments has allowed deriving a full set of thermodynamic parameters, including the helix reversal penalty (HRP) and the mismatch penalty (MMP). The results described illustrate the influence exerted by the number of stereogenic centers per monomeric unit and the temperature on the chiral amplification phenomenon. While the HRP decreases upon decreasing the number of chiral side chains, the MMP follows an opposite trend. The experimental trend observed in MR experiments contrasts with that reported for benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs), for which the chiral amplification ability increases by lowering the number of stereogenic centers or increasing the temperature. Theoretical calculations predict that the rotational angle between adjacent monomeric units in the stack (ca. 18°) gradually decreases when decreasing the number of branched chiral side chains and leads to higher MMP values, in good accord with the experimental trend. The reduction of the rotational angle gives rise to less efficient H-bonding interactions between the peripheral amide functional groups and is suggested to provoke a decrease of the HRP as experimentally observed. In BTAs, increasing the number of stereogenic centers per monomeric unit results in a negligible change of the rotation angle between adjacent units (ca. 65°), and, consequently, the steric bulk increases with the number of chiral side chains, leading to higher MMP values. The data presented herein contribute to shed light on the parameters controlling the transfer and amplification of chirality processes in supramolecular polymers, highlighting the enormous influence exerted by the size of the self-assembling unit on the final helical outcome.",

Here, we report a cross-catenane formed between two position-isomeric Pt(II) metallacages in the solid state. These two metallacages formed [2]catenanes in solution, whereas a 1:1 mixture selectively formed a cross-catenane in crystals. Varied temperature nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and time-of-flight mass spectra are employed to characterize the cross-catenation in solutions, and the dynamic library of [2]catenanes are shown. Additionally, we searched for the global-minimum structures of three [2]catenanes and re-optimized the low-lying structures using density functional theory calculations. Our results suggest that the binding energy of cross-catenanes is significantly larger than that of self-catenanes within the dynamic library, and the selectivity in crystallization of cross-catenanes is thermodynamic. This study presents a cross-catenated assembly from different metallacages, which may provide a facile insight for the development of low-symmetry/high-complexity self-assemble systems.",

First, the formation of cholesterol/β-cyclodextrin derivative complexes was investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Secondly, the conformations of β-cyclodextrin derivatives were determined from experimental and calculated 1H NMR spectra, and the weak interactions between cholesterol and β-cyclodextrin derivatives were studied by computational approach. Cholesterol/hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin complex had the lowest complexation energy. Besides, two moderate hydrogen bonds were formed between cholesterol and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and between cholesterol and sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin, while one weak hydrogen bond was formed between cholesterol and methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Finally, the efficiency of cholesterol removal by hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin was 5.47% higher than that by β-cyclodextrin at their optimal temperature. This work provided a theoretical basis for selecting a competent adsorbent to effectively remove cholesterol from high-melting-point foods.",

Catalyzing epoxides and CO2 cycloaddition reactions homogeneously with rare-earth compounds is an emerging approach. The reaction efficiency can be understood by mechanism study. In this work, we report a detailed density functional theory investigation on a well-designed experimental Sm catalyst. We calibrate the ωB97XD exchange–correlation functional as the best candidate functional for this specific catalytic system. The energetic span of catalytic cycle is approximately 25 kcal mol−1. The rate-determining transition state is the one for ring-closure to generate the product. Two competing paths are revealed. Through both ionic and covalent metal–ligand interactions, the lowering of the epoxide substrate ring-opening step barrier is significant compared with the Sm compound free case. This work demonstrate the values for utilizing modern density functional theory to complement the understandings on the homogeneous rare-earth catalytic processes.",

            "abstract": "Ionic liquids (ILs) are emerging as promising materials for the separation of heavy metals from complex feed streams through selective complexation. A predictive understanding of the coordination chemistry between ILs and targeted metal ions is critically important for enabling the rational design of efficient and selective separations. Such understanding is challenging to obtain due to the labile nature of the bonds and complicated structures formed by ILs in solution. Herein, we elucidated the complex formation of imidazolium-based ILs (i.e., 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, EMIMCl) with lead cations (Pb2+) in both the gas and aqueous phases employing a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Gas-phase electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy (NIPES) experiments suggest that Pb–Cl anions (e.g., PbCl3− and Pb2Cl5−) combine with neutral EMIMCl molecules, forming complexes of [PbmCl2m+1][EMIMCl]n− (m = 1, 2, n = 1–4). These anionic complexes are shown to become less stable toward fragmentation and require more energy to dissociate an electron with an increasing number of EMIMCl molecules. In contrast, in dilute solutions, dissociated EMIM+ cations and Cl− anions give rise to electrostatic screening of Pb–Cl bonds, resulting in the formation of distinct condensed phase complexes, such as [PbCl5][EMIM]2. These structures were identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO–LUMO) of the condensed phase complexes containing EMIM+ was calculated to be lower compared to the Pb–Cl ionic clusters without IL, making these species more electrochemically reducible and easier to extract from solution. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding complexation between ILs and metal ions in designing efficient separation methods.",

Structural X-ray diffraction analysis of 21 different salts revealed the electrophilicity of the Te centers in their interactions with anions. Telluroniums’ propensity to form Lewis pairs was investigated with OPPh3. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy suggested that telluroniums can bind up to three OPPh3 molecules. Isotherm titration calorimetry showed that the related heats of association in 1,2-dichloroethane depend on the electronic properties of the substituents of the aryl moiety and on the nature of the counterion. The enthalpies of first association of OPPh3 span −0.5 to −5 kcal mol−1. Study of the affinity of telluroniums for OPPh3 by state-of-the-art DFT and ab-initio methods revealed the dominant Coulombic and dispersion interactions as well as an entropic effect favoring association in solution. Intermolecular orbital interactions between [Ar2MeTe]+ cations and OPPh3 are deemed insufficient on their own to ensure the cohesion of [Ar2MeTe ⋅ Bn]+ complexes in solution (B=Lewis base). Comparison of Grimme's and Tkatchenko's DFT-D4/MBD-vdW thermodynamics of formation of higher [Ar2MeTe ⋅ Bn]+ complexes revealed significant molecular size-dependent divergence of the two methodologies, with MBD yielding better agreement with experiment.",

            "abstract": "In the current study, we designed three novel compounds by merging two valuable nitrogen-containing pharmacophores, namely dihydropyrimidine (DHPM) and azole, within a single molecule. To obtain the target molecules, azole-linked benzaldehydes were initially synthesized via nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction between 4-fluorobenzaldehyde and pyrazole, imidazole, or 1,2,4-triazole. Afterward, Biginelli reaction was applied to yield azole-carrying DHPMs. Following structural confirmation, the obtained compounds were tested for their alpha (α)-glucosidase inhibitory and antimicrobial activities. According to the biological data, DHPM-P and DHPM-T showed strong inhibition values whereas DHPM-I failed to effectively inhibit the α-glucosidase enzyme. This situation was explained by molecular docking studies of all compounds into the binding site of alpha-glucosidase. The title compounds also presented moderate antibacterial and antifungal activities. Computational methods based on density functional tight binding (DFTB) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, along with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to analyze the reactive properties of the compounds. A combination of DFTB and DFT calculations was applied to obtain the lowest energy conformations of the molecules. Further computational analysis included calculations of local reactivity descriptors, such as molecular electrostatic potential and average local ionization energy, by applying DFT calculations. DFT calculations were also used to study intramolecular non-covalent interactions. MD simulations were employed to understand how title molecules behave in water and to obtain solubility parameters.",

The transition state of the reduction reaction was systematically calculated using the nudged elastic band and the semi-empirical tight-binding calculations. It is found that the large charge polarization on the Ag and Ag2O nanoclusters can modulate chitosan's surface reactivity. The formation of the metal hydrates is the rate-determining step for reducing CO2. The calculated activation energy of the order of 1.5 eV demonstrates that Ag and Ag2O /chitosan could be used as catalysts for converting to CO2 formic acid.",

Negatively and positively charged anthracenes do not react either with C60 or C70, due to a favored solvation in water medium and/or to detrimental interactions with positively-charged Pd(II) corners of SubPc-cage. Experiments with C60 and C70 rendered parallel results, although C70 proved more reactive, leading to anthracene cycloadducts by reaction in the α bonds. All the results have been rationalized by theoretical calculations at the GFN2-xTB level.",

            "abstract": "Enoxaparin (enox) is a low molecular weight heparin. Enox, which has side effects of thrombocytopenia and bleeding, requires monitoring drug therapy. The analysis method of enox in the blood plasma matrix needs a prior separation method. There has not been a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) synthesis for enox in earlier studies. Therefore, a novel MIP of enox was synthesized via microwave synthesizer workstation. This research aims to examine the application of in silico studies in selecting functional monomers and their comparison with enoxaparin before carrying out MIP synthesis. Enox as a template was polymerized with itaconic acid (ITA) as the best functional monomer; N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linking agent; water as a porogen; and ammonium persulfate as an initiator. Itaconic acid was selected using the in silico to calculate binding energy, and Gibbs free energy gives the smallest values. Itaconic acid and enoxaparin ratio was computed using DFT, and GFN2-xTB found that 1:6 was the best ratio. For calculations using molecular dynamics simulations, it was found that a ratio of 1:1 was the best, the same as in laboratory experiments using the job's plot. Polymerization was performed using a microwave at room temperature (28 °C) with an ITA ratio of 1:1, 1:4, and 1:6. Nonimprinted polymers (NIP) were similarly prepared without a template as a control. All polymer particles were characterized by spectral (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), thermal (thermogravimetric analysis–differential thermal gravimetry), and morphology (scanning electron microscope). The adsorption capacity for enox was carried out with MIP and NIP. The performance of MIP was evaluated by determining the imprinting factors calculated. The MIP 1:1, 1:4, and 1:6 displayed imprinting factor is 1.21, 0.68, and 0.68, respectively. The best ratio of ITA to Enox is 1:1.",

Density functional theory calculations on the structures of [Sc2O2(CO2)n]+ (n = 1–4) ion–molecule complexes reveal a typical end-on binding motif as well as bidentate and tridentate carbonate-containing configurations. As the number of attached CO2 molecules increases, activated forms tend to dominate the isomeric populations. Distortion energies are unveiled to account for the conversion barriers from molecularly bound isomers to carbonate structures, and show a monotonically decreasing trend with successive CO2 ligand addition. The infrared photodissociation spectra of target ion–molecule complexes were recorded in the 2100–2500 cm−1 frequency region and interpreted by comparison with simulated IR spectra of low-lying isomers representing distinct configurations, demonstrating a high possibility of carbonate structure formation in current experiments.",

            "abstract": "Precise control over the chirality and morphologies of polymer assemblies, a remaining challenge for both chemists and materials scientists, is receiving ever-increasing attention in the recent years. Herein, we report the subtle manipulation of the achiral spacers from the chiral stereocenter to the azobenzene (Azo) unit, of which the chiroptical consistency or chiroptical inversion of self-assemblies could be successfully controlled and present “two-fold” odd-even effect. Furthermore, morphological transitions from 0D spherical micelles, 1D worms, and nanowires to 3D vesicles, spindle- and dumbbell-shaped vesicles were also unexpectedly found to exhibit odd-even correlations. These observations were collectively elucidated by mesomorphic properties, stacking modes, chiroptical dynamics, and stimuli-responsive behaviors. Negligible modifications to the spacer structures can enable remarkable modulation of supramolecular chirality and anisotropic topologies in polymer assemblies, which is of great significance for the design of complex chiral functional polymers.",

            "abstract": "Molecular structure plays an important role in the selectivity and performance of catalysts. Understanding the impact of structural differences on catalyst performance via quantitative structure-selectivity relationships is key to developing high-performing catalytic systems. There are several methods that have been introduced to quantify steric contributions, including Tolman cone angles, Charton parameters, and A-values. While these have shown promise in predicting selectivity, they access similar, general steric contributions and are largely empirically derived. Alternatively, Sterimol parameters offer a specific multi-directional measure of steric bulk in the form of three vectors in units of distance. Recently, these parameters revealed strong correlations between structure and selectivity in asymmetric catalysis. Yet, despite their demonstrated performance, Sterimol parameters are commonly derived using van der Waals radii, which approximate molecular size using hard-spheres. This method may not accurately describe highly polarized systems. Recently, a new chemical system size metric based on the electric-field of a molecule was developed, which accesses the occupied space of a molecule. Here, we demonstrate that the electric field-derived Sterimol parameters reveal similar structure-selectivity relationships in asymmetric catalysis as conventional Sterimol parameters. Specifically, we present a computational workflow for calculating Sterimol parameters based on the size of a molecule’s electric field, and validate our method using several asymmetric catalysis reactions.",

Here we analyzed the effect of increasing the amount of supramolecular interactions on the glass transition temperature of polyketones by chemically modifying the same polymer backbone with five amine derivatives, namely (1-(3-aminopropyl)-imidazole, 4-(aminomethyl) benzoic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, benzylamine or hexylamine, at various molar concentrations. The grafting was performed via the Paal-Knorr reaction and the interactions between the pyrrole backbone and different grafted functional groups were elucidated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as differential scanning calorimetry and computational modeling. The modification of polyketone with 4-(aminomethyl) benzoic acid and 6-aminohexanoic acid, allowed for new possibilities of hydrogen bonding and led to a significant increase in the glass transition temperature as compared to the neat polymer and pyrrole-containing polymers that did not bear reactive side groups. In contrast, modification with the imidazole derivative was found to introduce new and more robust CH⋯π interactions between imidazole groups and the π-system of the pyrrole backbone chain, based on electrostatic effects. Both types of supramolecular interactions affect the mobility of the backbone chains and this systematic study demonstrates how the combined effect of π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding to carboxylate moieties can be used to tune the molecular mobility and phase transition temperature of these chemically modified polyketones.",

            "abstract": "Converting industrial residual lignin into monophenolic compounds remains a formidable challenge within biorefinery processes, especially when dealing with highly polymerized lignin. This study focuses on the depolymerization of industrial softwood enzyme hydrolysis lignin (SEHL), a by-product of bioethanol production, which possesses a substantial molar mass (M̅w ˃ 10000 g/mol), The approach involves utilizing acidic or alkaline deep eutectic solvent (DES) for pre-depolymerization, followed by rapid pyrolysis, achieving the selective generation of phenolic monomers. Applying acidic or alkaline DES pretreatments initiates depolymerization by breaking the β–aryl ether bonds (β–O–4) in lignin, but consequently triggers distinct reaction pathways. It is found that this pre-depolymerization leads to higher yields of phenolic monomers dominated by 4–methylguaiacol during the subsequent pyrolysis, moreover, the yields resulted from acidic DES-lignin were much higher than those from alkaline DES-lignin. We have comprehensively elucidated the lignin depolymerization process during DES pretreatments through computational simulations and experimental investigations. These efforts have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in the structural changes of DES-lignin. Furthermore, we have established a more profound comprehension of how both acidic and alkaline DES pretreatments enhance the performance of lignin pyrolysis. This study emphasizes the importance of thoroughly understanding the intricate interplay between lignin structure and its thermochemical properties. Such insights are crucial for efficiently valorizing highly polymerized lignin to produce valuable phenolic compounds using the rapid pyrolysis technique.",

We explore potential point defects with spin–1/2 discovered through electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments. We consider defects through substitution of one Cu(II) centre in the dimer with protons, or through one-electron reduction, affording a mixed-valence dimer. While most of the defects have predicted pNMR shifts at room temperature in the range of those for the non-defective MOFs, their detection and assignment should be possible based on their distinct temperature dependence.",

Herein, we report a PLY-based dinuclear [FeIII2(hmbh-PLY)3] complex, 1, and its utility as a cathode material in a H2O2 fuel cell. Complex 1 was synthesized from a new Schiff base ligand, (E)-9-(2-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)hydrazineyl)-1H-phenalen-1-one, hmbh-PLYH2, designed using a PLY precursor, Hz-PLY. The newly derived ligand and complex 1 were characterized by various analytical techniques, including single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) study revealed that complex 1 undergoes five electron reductions under an applied electric potential. When the electroactive complex 1 was employed as a cathode in a membrane-less one-compartment H2O2 fuel cell, with Ni foam as the corresponding anode, the designed fuel cell exhibited an exceptionally high peak power density (PPD) of 2.41 mW cm−2, in comparison with those of all the previously reported Fe-based molecular complexes. DFT studies were performed to gain reasonable insights into the two-electron catalytic reduction (pathway I) of H2O2 by the Fe-center of complex 1 and to explore the geometries, energetics of the electrocatalyst, reactive intermediates and transition states.",

Achiral counterions have been found to play crucial roles in modulating reactivity and selectivity. The modular nature of an ion pair catalyst allows rapid alterations of the achiral counterion to achieve optimal outcomes, without the need to modify the more onerous chiral component. In this study, we report the successful development of a stable chiral pentanidium pyridinyl-sulphonamide ion pair as a nucleophilic organocatalyst for asymmetric Steglich rearrangement. The ion pair catalyst demonstrated excellent performance, leading to enantioenriched products with up to 99% ee through simple alterations of the achiral anions. We conducted extensive ROESY experiments and concluded that the reactivity and enantioselectivity were correlated to the formation of a tight ion pair in solution. Further computational analyses provided greater clarity to the structure of the ion pair catalyst in solution. Our findings reveal the critical roles of NMR experiments and computational analyses in the design and optimisation of ion pair catalysts.",

            "abstract": "Fragmentation-based methods for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift calculations have become more and more popular in first-principles calculations of large molecules. However, there are many options for a fragmentation-based method to select, such as theoretical methods, fragmentation schemes, the number of levels of theory, etc. It is important to study the optimal combination of the options to achieve a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. Here we investigate different combinations of options used by a fragmentation-based method, the eXtended ONIOM (XO) method, for 13C chemical shift calculations on a set of organic and biological molecules. We found that: (1) introducing Hartree-Fock exchange into density functional theory (DFT) could reduce the calculation error due to fragmentation in contrast to pure DFT functionals, while a hybrid functional, xOPBE, is generally recommended; (2) fragmentation schemes generated from the molecular tailoring approach (MTA) with small level parameter n, for example, n = 2 and the degree-based fragmentation method (DBFM) with n = 1, are sufficient to achieve satisfactory accuracy; (3) the two-level XO (XO2) NMR calculation is superior to the calculation with only one level of theory, as the second level (i.e., low level) of theory provides a way to well describe the long-range effect. These findings are beneficial to practical applications of fragmentation-based methods for NMR chemical shift calculations of large molecules.",

Here, we report the synthesis of novel diiron complexes with an indole-functionalized vinyliminium ligand (2–5) and an indole-lacking analogue for comparative purposes (6), which were characterized by analytical and spectroscopic techniques. Complexes 2–6 are substantially stable in DMSO‑d6 and DMEM-d solutions at 37 °C (8% average degradation after 48 h) and display a balanced hydrophilic/lipophilic behaviour (LogPow values in the range −0.32 to 0.47), associated with appreciable water solubility. The complexes display selective antiproliferative potency towards several cancer cells in monolayer cultures, mainly in the low micromolar range, with reduced toxicity towards noncancerous epithelial cells. Thus, the cytotoxicity of the complexes is comparable to or better than clinically used metallopharmaceutical cisplatin. Comparing the antiproliferative activity obtained for complexes containing different ligands, we confirmed the importance of the indolyl group in the mechanism of antiproliferative activity of these complexes. Cell-based mechanistic studies suggest that the investigated diiron vinyliminium complexes (DVCs) show cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects and subsequently induce a population of cells to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of action involves interactions with mitochondrial DNA and proteins, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging properties and antioxidant activity of these complexes in cancer cells. This study highlights the importance of DVCs to their cancer cell activity and reinforces their prospective therapeutic potential as anticancer agents.",

            "abstract": "Biodegradable packaging films containing natural bioactive ingredients emerge nowadays to respond to increasing demands for safety, health, and sustainability in the food industry. The biodegradable active composite films were constructed for the first time using chia seed mucilage (CSM) and chitosan (CS) as film-forming materials and Xanthoceras sorbifolium Bunge (X. sorbifolium) leaf extract as an active ingredient, namely the CSM/CS/X films. The effects of active component contents (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 wt%) on the microstructure, mechanical, thermodynamic properties, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of the composite film were studied. Interestingly, the CSM/CS/X4 film which contains 4 wt% of X. sorbifolium leaf extract has relatively better micromorphology and performance than other films. Compared with the blank CSM/CS film, the CSM/CS/X films incorporated with X. sorbifolium leaf extract sustainably display good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The all-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal the helix structure of the CSM/CS/X films, showing that introducing extract promotes the formation of the composite film through enhanced Coulomb and van der Waals interactions. The results suggest that low-value X. sorbifolium leaf can be used to prepare eco-friendly functional packaging films, which are expected to replace petroleum-based packaging materials that can improve the quality and freshness of food. The study provides a new and effective way for the recycling and value-added utilization of biowaste.",

            "abstract": "With relevant chemical space growing larger and larger by the day, the ability to extend computational tractability over that larger space is of paramount importance in virtually all fields of science. The solution we aim to provide here for this issue is in the form of the generalized many-body expansion for building density matrices (GMBE-DM) based on the set-theoretical derivation with overlapping fragments, through which the energy can be obtained by a single Fock build. In combination with the purification scheme and the truncation at the one-body level, the DM-based GMBE(1)-DM-P approach shows both highly accurate absolute and relative energies for medium-to-large size water clusters with about an order of magnitude better than the corresponding energy-based GMBE(1) scheme. Simultaneously, GMBE(1)-DM-P is about an order of magnitude faster than the previously proposed MBE-DM scheme [F. Ballesteros and K. U. Lao, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 179 (2022)] and is even faster than a supersystem calculation without significant parallelization to rescue the fragmentation method. For even more challenging systems including ion–water and ion–pair clusters, GMBE(1)-DM-P also performs about 3 and 30 times better than the energy-based GMBE(1) approach, respectively. In addition, this work provides the first overlapping fragmentation algorithm with a robust and effective binning scheme implemented internally in a popular quantum chemistry software package. Thus, GMBE(1)-DM-P opens a new door to accurately and efficiently describe noncovalent clusters using quantum mechanics.",

The NDI 1, with free imidic NH groups, spontanously self-assembles via hydrogen bonds into a columnar LC structure where the chromophores organize with the cores parallel to the columnar axis. Quantum mechanics calculations (GFN2-xTB method) and middle angle X-ray scattering confirmed the uncommon columnar architecture for the LC 1 which enable strong J-type exciton coupling between NDI cores. On the other hand, the NDI 2, with N-butyl groups at the imide positions, spontaneously self-assembles by cofacial π–π stacking into columnar H-aggregates; however mechanical shearing of the samples induces the reversible formation of weakly coupled J-aggregates. Surprisingly, this mechanochromic behavior is induced by a molecular reorganization of the NDI cores, which is accompanied by a fluorescence turn on. Thus, in this work we successfully applied two approaches to prepare for the first time LC NDI J-aggregates, which are highly appreciated materials for photonic applications.",

            "abstract": "Deep generative models have emerged as an exciting avenue for inverse molecular design, with progress coming from the interplay between training algorithms and molecular representations. One of the key challenges in their applicability to materials science and chemistry has been the lack of access to sizeable training datasets with property labels. Published patents contain the first disclosure of new materials prior to their publication in journals, and are a vast source of scientific knowledge that has remained relatively untapped in the field of data-driven molecular design. Because patents are filed seeking to protect specific uses, molecules in patents can be considered to be weakly labeled into application classes. Furthermore, patents published by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) are downloadable and have machine-readable text and molecular structures. In this work, we train domain-specific generative models using patent data sources by developing an automated pipeline to go from USPTO patent digital files to the generation of novel candidates with minimal human intervention. We test the approach on two in-class extracted datasets, one in organic electronics and another in tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We then evaluate the ability of generative models trained on these in-class datasets on two categories of tasks (distribution learning and property optimization), identify strengths and limitations, and suggest possible explanations and remedies that could be used to overcome these in practice.",

            "abstract": "In the petrochemical industry, the separation of C4 olefins is crucial but a challenging and energy-intensive process. In this study, two fluorinated anion-pillared hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs), namely KAUST-7 (NbOFFIVE-1-Ni) and KAUST-8 (AlFFIVE-1-Ni), were explored for the efficient separation of ternary C4 olefin mixtures (C4H6/n-C4H8/iso-C4H8) via gate-opening and size-sieving effects. KAUST-7, with a narrow and flexible pore window that completely excludes iso-C4H8, but allows for the absorption of C4H6 and n-C4H8 through gate-opening effects, with a preferential adsorption of C4H6 due to its easier access to the channel. KAUST-8, on the other hand, with a larger pore window size and the strong H-bond interactions between the electronegative fluorine atoms from inorganic anion pillar and the C4 olefin molecules, efficiently separates iso-C4H8 from C4 olefins, as the adsorption of both C4H6 and n-C4H8 is significantly enhanced while iso-C4H8 retains much lower adsorption capacity. The relationship between the structures and separation properties of these materials is discussed, providing insight into the development of efficient separation materials. Fixed bed breakthrough experiments verify the excellent separation performances of KAUST-7 and KAUST-8 for C4H6/n-C4H8/iso-C4H8, highlighting their potential for industrial applications.",

Mechanosensitivity describes a change in conductance for a certain change in electrode separation and is a desirable feature for applications such as ultrasensitive stress sensors. We combine methods of artificial intelligence with high-level simulations based on electronic structure theory to construct optimized mechanosensitive molecules from predefined, modular molecular building blocks. In this way, we overcome time-consuming, inefficient trial-and-error cycles in molecular design. We unveil the black box machinery usually connected to methods of artificial intelligence by presenting all-important evolutionary processes. We identify the general features that characterize well-performing molecules and point out the crucial role of spacer groups for increased mechanosensitivity. Our genetic algorithm provides a powerful way to search chemical space and to identify the most promising molecular candidates.",

            "abstract": "We provide a comprehensive investigation of intermolecular interactions between atmospheric gaseous pollutants, including CH4, CO, CO2, NO, NO2, SO2, as well as H2O and Agn (n = 1–22) or Aun (n = 1–20) atomic clusters. The optimized geometries of all the systems investigated in our study were determined using density functional theory (DFT) with M06-2X functional and SDD basis set. The PNO-LCCSD-F12/SDD method was used for more accurate single-point energy calculations. Compared to their isolated states, the structures of the Agn and Aun clusters undergo severe deformations upon adsorption of the gaseous species, which become more significant as the size of the clusters decreases. Considering that, in addition to adsorption energy, we have determined the interaction and deformation energy of all the systems. All our calculations consistently show that among the gaseous species examined, SO2 and NO2 exhibit a higher preference for adsorption on both types of clusters, with a slightly higher preference for the Ag clusters compared to the Au clusters, with the SO2/Ag16 system exhibiting the lowest adsorption energy. The type of intermolecular interactions was investigated through wave function analyses, including natural bond orbital (NBO) and quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), showing that NO2 and SO2 are chemisorbed on the Agn and Aun atomic clusters, whereas the other gas molecules exhibit a much weaker interaction with them. The reported data can be used as input parameters for molecular dynamics simulations to study the selectivity of atomic clusters towards specific gases under ambient conditions, as well as to design materials that take advantage of the studied intermolecular interactions.",

Through a coordination-driven self-assembly approach, metallacycle M surrounded by alkyl chains was successfully constructed from tetraphenylethylene (TPE) building blocks in nearly quantitative yield. Interestingly, from the prepared metallacycle M, star-shaped supramolecular complex M-3 and cross-linked supramolecular network M-4 with one-step energy-transfer properties were efficiently fabricated based on host–guest interactions. Furthermore, from M-3 and M-4, two different artificial light-harvesting systems (LHSs) with two-step sequential energy transfer characteristics were efficiently prepared via supramolecular interactions. The two types of LHSs were compared in detail, and the critical factors affecting the light-harvesting efficiency, including the photophysical properties, aggregation-induced emission characteristics, energy transfer efficiency, and antenna effect, were carefully analysed. Additionally, both of the artificial LHSs, M-3-5 and M-4-5, showed excellent energy transfer efficiency and high antenna effects. This research provides an efficient hierarchical self-assembly approach to construct artificial LHSs featuring excellent energy transfer efficiency and high antenna effects with diverse architectures.",

We identify 435 candidates, virtually all of which contain an azetidine N as the catalytically active site, which is discovered by the GA. Two molecules are selected for further study based on their predicted synthetic accessibility and have predicted rate-determining barriers that are lower than that of a known catalyst. Azetidines have not been used as catalysts for the MBH reaction. One suggested azetidine is successfully synthesized and showed an eightfold increase in activity over a commonly used catalyst. We believe this is the first experimentally verified de novo discovery of an efficient catalyst using a generative model.",

LSJ-HPP had better color quality with higher values of L*, a*, and total anthocyanin content (TAC), the corresponding percent polymeric color and browning index were 41% and 16% lower than those of HSJ-HPP, respectively. TAC in LSJ-HPP, HSJ, and HSJ-HPP decreased to 9.5, 8.6, and 6.0 mg/kg (pomegranate puree) after storage, respectively. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside formed more H-bonds with LMA than HMP, while their total interaction energy and the binding frequency and number were also higher. This study provided a foundation for the processing and storage of high quality LSJ, and also broadened the application field of HPP technology.",

            "abstract": "The valence ionization of uracil and mixed water–uracil clusters has been studied experimentally and by ab initio calculations. In both measurements, the spectrum onset shows a red shift with respect to the uracil molecule, with the mixed cluster characterized by peculiar features unexplained by the sum of independent contributions of the water or uracil aggregation. To interpret and assign all the contributions, we performed a series of multi-level calculations, starting from an exploration of several cluster structures using automated conformer-search algorithms based on a tight-binding approach. Ionization energies have been assessed on smaller clusters via a comparison between accurate wavefunction-based approaches and cost-effective DFT-based simulations, the latter of which were applied to clusters up to 12 uracil and 36 water molecules. The results confirm that (i) the bottom-up approach based on a multilevel method [Mattioli et al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23, 1859 (2021)] to the structure of neutral clusters of unknown experimental composition converges to precise structure–property relationships and (ii) the coexistence of pure and mixed clusters in the water–uracil samples. A natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis performed on a subset of clusters highlighted the special role of H-bonds in the formation of the aggregates. The NBO analysis yields second-order perturbative energy between the H-bond donor and acceptor orbitals correlated with the calculated ionization energies. This sheds light on the role of the oxygen lone-pairs of the uracil CO group in the formation of strong H-bonds, with a stronger directionality in mixed clusters, giving a quantitative explanation for the formation of core–shell structures.",

Here we report a polymorphic tungsten catalyst with a concerted tungsten single-atom site (W-SAC) and tungsten nitride nanoclusters (WN-NPs) for mediating the ORR processes. The catalyst is prepared via pyrolysis of phthalocyanine-typed material (WPc) with g-C3N4. Synergy of the W-SAC and WN-NP sites over the designed 2D g-C3N4 layer is responsible for the competitive ORR performance of the catalysts. Consequently, the WNPc/gC3N4-700 sample gives a half-wave potential of 0.835 V, a Tafel slope of 40.47mV dec−1, and a mass diffusion-limited current of 0.596 mA/cm2; such results are comparable with and even better than that of 20% Pt/C. Furthermore, WNPc/gC3N4-700 also outperforms 20% Pt/C in terms of stability and durability. Our work may point toward a design strategy for active, stable, non-noble-metal ORR catalysts.",

An open question is how collagen absorbs pulling forces, and if the applied forces are strong enough to break bonds, what mechanisms underlie this process. As experimental studies on this topic are challenging, simulations are an important tool to further our understanding of these mechanisms. Here, we present pulling simulations of collagen triple helices, revealing the molecular mechanisms induced by tensile stress. At lower forces, pulling alters the configuration of proline residues leading to an effective absorption of applied stress. When forces are strong enough to introduce bond ruptures, these are located preferentially in X-position residues. Reduced backbone flexibility, for example through mutations or cross linking, weakens tensile resistance, leading to localised ruptures around these perturbations. In fibre-like segments, a significant overrepresentation of ruptures in proline residues compared to amino acid contents is observed. This study confirms the important role of proline in the structural stability of collagen, and adds detailed insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this observation.",

To accelerate the discovery of novel TADF materials, computer-aided material design strategies have been developed. However, they have clear limitations due to the accessibility of only a few computationally tractable properties. Here, we propose TADF-likeness, a quantitative score to evaluate the TADF potential of molecules based on a data-driven concept of chemical similarity to existing TADF molecules. We used a deep autoencoder to characterize the common features of existing TADF molecules with common chemical descriptors. The score was highly correlated with the four essential electronic properties of TADF molecules and had a high success rate in large-scale virtual screening of millions of molecules to identify promising candidates at almost no cost, validating its feasibility for accelerating TADF discovery. The concept of TADF-likeness can be extended to other fields of materials discovery.",

Covalent organic nanotubes (CONs) can be prepared by stacking building blocks, such as macrocycles, through covalent linkages. However, because of the mismatched covalent connections, controllable synthesis of the discrete CONs with clear structures, such as sidewall and chirality, is a challenging target. In this work, by coupling two pillar[5]arenes through dynamic covalent bonds, thermodynamically stable discrete CONs with 5-fold symmetry are successfully prepared. Three different chiral CONs are separated, including homo-CONs, consisting of two enantiomers (pR, pR and pS, pS), and hetero-CON, consisting of the meso form (pR, pS). These CONs show negative allosteric binding affinities toward guest molecules, which are not observed in individual pillar[5]arenes.",

In this work, the density functional theory, the wavefunction analysis of the excited state, and the quantum theory of atoms in molecules are used to calculate and analyze the anti-symmetric chiral characteristics of zigzag-edge twisted bilayer graphene quantum dots based on periodic complementary twisted angles. The analysis of the partial density of states shows that Moiré superlattices can effectively adjust the contribution of the atomic basis function of the fragment to the transition dipole moment. The topological analysis of electron density indicates that the Moiré superlattices structure can enhance the localization of the system, increasing the electron density of the Moiré central ring, reducing the electron surge capacity in general and inducing the reversed helical properties of the top and underlying graphene, which can be used as the origin of the chiral discrimination; it also reveals the mole in the superlattice chiral physical mechanism. On this basis, we will also study the nonlinear optical properties of twisted bilayer graphene based on a twisted angle.",

            "abstract": "This work studied the optical absorption properties and electronic properties of graphene nanosheets encapsulated in h-BN at different twisted angles based on first principles. UV–Vis spectrum shows that compared with the monolayer graphene nanosheets, the absorption’s peak of the encapsulated graphene nanosheets show a red shift and its molar absorption coefficient decreased significantly. The molar absorption coefficients of h-BN/graphene/h-BN heterostructures show an increasing trend when the graphene nanosheets are twisted relative to the packaging layer (twisted angles are 0°, 15°, 21.8°, 27.8° and 30°, respectively). More curiously, charge density difference (CDD) indicates that the region of electron aggregation in excited state mainly occurs at the centre of graphene nanosheets due to the introduction of h-BN packaging layer. The smoothed isosurface diagram of electron hole pairs shows that the distribution breadth of electron hole pair density decreases compared with that before encapsulation, and the distribution breadth of electron increase is larger than that of hole. With the increase of twisted angles, the distribution breadth of electron hole pair density increases gradually. Both CDD and smoothed isosurface diagram show that the system has strong boundary effect. This provides a method to adjust the photoelectric properties of graphene nanosheets by using different twisted angles, and provides a theoretical basis for its application in the field of micro-nano optoelectronics.",

The deposition of PbS was carried out inside and outside the polymer chains using the ionic adsorption deposition process. Various analyses were conducted to confirm the chemical structure and morphological, optical, and electrical properties of the resulting composite. TEM and SEM analyses demonstrated the spherical shape of PbS particles inside and outside the PANI network with more dark or white color, respectively. Moreover, the ImageJ program confirmed the composite formation. The XRD characterization showed the shifts in the PANI peaks after the composite formation with the appearance of a new additional peak related to PbS nanoparticles. The optical analyses were massively enhanced after the composite formation with more broadening in the Vis region at 630 nm, in which there was more enhancement in the bandgap that reached 1.5 eV. The electrode application in the H2 generation process was carried out from wastewater (sewage water, third treatment) without any additional sacrificing agent. The electrode responded well to light, where the current density () changed from 10-6 to 0.13 mA.cm-2 under dark and light, respectively. The electrode had high reproducibility and stability. The numbers of generated H2 moles were 0.1 mmol/cm2.h. The produced and were 7.3 kJ/mol and 273.4 J/mol.K, respectively. Finally, the mechanism explains the H2 generation reaction using three-electrode cell.",

Generally, cobalt incorporation led to higher activities for the alcohol oxidation (AOR) compared to the Cu-only material and the results are compared with the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER). On the Cu-Co hydroxycarbonates, the electrooxidation of vicinal alcohols such as glycerol and ethylene glycol requires lower overpotentials than EOR and OER. Cu leaching from the hydroxycarbonate structure was observed in the presence of vicinal alcohols. The impact of chemical and electrochemical leaching of copper from the catalysts has been studied. The chemically leached catalyst was found to show increased AOR activity compared to other hydroxycarbonates, enabling the formation of larger amounts of formic acid during GOR measured in a circular flow cell electrolyzer. The results highlight that Cu-Co hydroxycarbonates can be used as precursors to generate electrocatalytically active materials from Cu-Co hydroxycarbonates for the AOR in alkaline solution.",

            "abstract": "Anthraquinone (AQ) has long been identified as a highly promising lead structure for various applications in organic electronics. Considering the enormous number of possible substitution patterns of the AQ lead structure, with only a minority being commercially available, a systematic experimental screening of the associated electrochemical potentials represents a highly challenging and time consuming task, which can be greatly enhanced via suitable virtual pre-screening techniques. In this work the calculated electrochemical reduction potentials of pristine AQ and 12 hydroxy- or/and amino-substituted AQ derivatives in N,N-dimethylformamide have been correlated against newly measured experimental data. In addition to the calculations performed using density functional theory (DFT), the performance of different semi-empirical density functional tight binding (DFTB) approaches has been critically assessed. It was shown that the SCC DFTB/3ob parametrization in conjunction with the COSMO solvation model provides a highly adequate description of the electrochemical potentials also in the case of the two-fold reduced species. While the quality in the correlation against the experimental data proved to be slightly inferior compared to the employed DFT approach, the highly advantageous cost-accuracy ratio of the SCC DFTB/3ob/COSMO framework has important implications in the formulation of hierarchical screening strategies for materials associated with organic electronics. Based on the observed performance, the low-cost method provides sufficiently accurate results to execute efficient pre-screening protocols, which may then be followed by a DFT-based refinement of the best candidate structures to facilitate a systematic search for new, high-performance organic electronic materials.",

            "abstract": "Materials optimization for organic solar cells (OSCs) is a highly active field, with many approaches using empirical experimental synthesis, computational brute force to screen a subset of chemical space, or generative machine learning methods that often require significant training sets. While these methods may find high-performing materials, they can be inefficient and time-consuming. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are an alternative approach, allowing for the “virtual synthesis” of molecules and a prediction of their “fitness” for some property, with new candidates suggested based on good characteristics of previously generated molecules. In this work, a GA is used to discover high-performing unfused non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) based on an empirical prediction of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and provides design rules for future work. The electron-withdrawing/donating strength, as well as the sequence and symmetry, of those units are examined. The utilization of a GA over a brute-force approach resulted in speedups up to 1.8 × 1012. New types of units, not frequently seen in OSCs, are suggested, and in total 5426 NFAs are discovered with the GA. Of these, 1087 NFAs are predicted to have a PCE greater than 18%, which is roughly the current record efficiency. While the symmetry of the sequence showed no correlation with PCE, analysis of the sequence arrangement revealed that higher performance can be achieved with a donor core and acceptor end groups. Future NFA designs should consider this strategy as an alternative to the current A-D-A′-D-A architecture.",

Naphthyl or pyrenyl fluorogenic units were introduced at the lower rim of the calixarene skeleton via a butyl spacer. The binding of biologically and environmentally relevant anions was studied with NMR, UV–vis absorption, and fluorescence titrations. Fluorescence of the pyrenyl receptor 4c displays both monomer and excimer fluorescence. The thermodynamics of complexation was determined in acetonitrile and was entropy-driven. Computational studies were also performed to bring further insight into the binding process. The data showed that association constants increase with the anion basicity, and AcO−, BzO− and F− were the best bound anions for all receptors. Pyrenylurea 4c is a slightly better receptor than naphthylurea 4a, and both are more efficient than naphthyl thiourea 4b. In addition, ureas 4a and 4c were also tested as ditopic receptors in the recognition of alkylammonium salts.",

The corresponding free binding energies were corrected by the hydrocarbon computed solvation energies to obtain their free energies of transfer from the gas phase to the CB[8]/auxiliary guest cavity. These energies correlate linearly with the hydrocarbon static polarizabilities, thereby suggesting that the selectivity is driven, perhaps exclusively, by dispersive interactions between the hydrocarbons and the tailor-made cavity, regardless of the degree of unsaturation of the guests. The free energies of transfer also correlate linearly with the energy released upon introduction of the hydrocarbon into a pre-formed cavity extruded from a solvent (benzene) selected to mimic the polarity and polarizability of the CB[8]/auxiliary probe cavity – and this, with a unity slope. Among other features, this empirical model also accurately predicts the relative binding affinities of various rigid hydrocarbons to CB[6] and CB[7], as well as noble gases to CB[5], when the macrocycles are mimicked with pre-formed cavities in perfluorohexane or perfluorohexane/benzene mixtures, both being notoriously non-polar and non-polarizable environments.",

The inter-layer local excitation in the electronic transition and intra-layer charge transfer dominated by MS and anti-symmetric electron-hole pair density induced by PDOS are discussed. The twisted angle is decisive to the absorption spectrum, large twisted angle will lead to the red shift of the absorption spectrum. The two-photon transition shows that the twisted angle can regulate the TPA cross section and the boundary effect of Z-TwBLG-QDs in a specific wavelength range. The edge effect of two-step transition can be enhanced by MS with specific twisted angles. The physical mechanism of twisted angle regulating electron transition behavior is revealed by magnetic induction current density analysis.",

All structures were divided into three series (Au3Agm, Au4Agm, and Au5Agm), and each series was divided into different groups depending on the Au atom position in the cluster. The most stable clusters (Au3Ag15, Au4Ag15, and Au5Ag11) have π-electron delocalization systems, which induce a spatial aromaticity in these structures.",

Various asymmetric oxidative reactions were applied to evaluate the reactivities and stereoselectivities of those reagents. Moderate to excellent yields were observed; however, very low stereoselectivities were obtained. NMR experiments indicated that these reagents are very easily hydrolysed in either chloroform or DMSO solvents leading to the limited stereoselectivities. It is concluded that the use of chiral ligands is an unsuccessful way to prepare efficient stereoselective iodine(III) reagents.",

            "abstract": "Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA), an alternative of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been detected frequently in environmental media worldwide. It has been reported that HFPO-DA is equal to or more toxic than PFOA, as well as more recalcitrant to degradation. In this study, the efficient degradation of HFPO-DA was achieved by the thermally activated persulfate (TAP) system, but the influence of co-contaminants in the field can be significant. The degradation pathways of HFPO-DA were proposed through an integrated approach of experiment and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. CF3CF2COO− and CF3COO−, were the stable intermediates identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Electron transfer, decarboxylation, H abstraction, HF elimination using H2O as a catalyst and hydrolysis occurred in different steps of HFPO-DA degradation process, with –COO− as the initial oxidative site attacked by SO4−. In addition, the acute toxicity assessment for HFPO-DA degradation in the TAP system performed by Escherichia coli suggested that HFPO-DA was degraded to a level having no adverse effect on the growth of E. coli, and no more toxic intermediates were formed. Overall, this work provides insights for the degradation of HFPO-DA contamination by the TAP system.",

            "abstract": "Atom Probe Tomography (APT) is currently a well-established technique to analyse the composition of solid materials including metals, semiconductors and ceramics with up to near-atomic resolution. Using an aqueous glucose solution, we now extended the technique to frozen solutions. While the mass signals of the common glucose fragments CxHy and CxOyHz overlap with (H2O)nH from water, we achieved stoichiometrically correct values via signal deconvolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the stability of the detected pyranose fragments. This paper demonstrates APT’s capabilities to achieve sub-nanometre resolution in tracing whole glucose molecules in a frozen solution by using cryogenic workflows. We use a solution of defined concentration to investigate the chemical resolution capabilities as a step toward the measurement of biological molecules. Due to the evaporation of nearly intact glucose molecules, their position within the measured 3D volume of the solution can be determined with sub-nanometre resolution. Our analyses take analytical techniques to a new level, since chemical characterization methods for cryogenically-frozen solutions or biological materials are limited.",

            "abstract": "A cellulose-based composite adsorbent (PEI-PAM-CF) was fabricated via a facile cross-linking of polyethyleneimine/polyacrylamide (PEI/PAM) and cellulose using epichlorohydrin as the cross-linker. It possessed a double-network structure and emitted blue fluorescence. Compared with the control samples (PEI-CF and PAM-CF), the PEI-PAM-CF showed a synergy effect for the Cr(VI) removal. It can effectively remove Cr(VI) at low concentration with no structure destroyed for the adsorbent. Other coexisting anions (NO3-, Cl-, H2PO4- and CH3COO-) and cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Cr3+) had no significant effect on Cr(VI) removal except SO42-. After five adsorption/desorption cycles, the Cr(VI) removal only decreased with a loss of 7%, suggesting that the PEI-PAM-CF had good regeneration performance. Most importantly, the electrostatic adsorption mechanism between Cr(VI) and the PEI-PAM-CF was revealed by a reversible fluorescence “on-off-on” phenomenon and the DFT calculation. The adsorption sites on the PEI-PAM-CF were attributed to the amino groups of the PEI and PAM. Hence, the PEI-PAM-CF was potential for the treatment of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater at low concentration.",

This research may help developing cyclodextrin-based pharmaceutical formulations through the choice of the appropriate solvent mixture that may be employed in the industrial application aiming to control the reactions/processes in liquid phase. In this paper, NMR results for the molecular complex formation between BA and β-CD ([BA⊂β-CD]) in D2O-DMSO-d6 and in D2O-EtOH have shown that the stability of the complex in the H2O-DMSO-d6 varies within the experimental error, while decreases in H2O-EtOH. Changes in the Gibbs energy of BA resolvation in water and water–dimethylsulfoxide mixtures have been obtained and have been used in the analysis of the reagent solvation contributions into the Gibbs energy changes of the [BA⊂β-CD] molecular complex formation. Quantum chemical calculations of the interaction energy between β-CD and BA as well as the structure of the [BA⊂β-CD] complex and the energy of β-CD and BA interaction in vacuum and in the medium of water, methanol and dimethylsulfoxide solvents are carried out. The stability of [BA⊂β-CD] complex in H2O-EtOH and H2O-DMSO solvents, obtained by different methods, are compared. The thermodynamic parameters of the [BA⊂β-CD] molecular complexation as well as the reagent solvation contributions in H2O-EtOH and H2O-DMSO mixtures were analyzed by the solvation-thermodynamic approach.",

            "abstract": "In this study, three novel cubic cages were synthesized and utilized to encapsulate a catalytically active cobalt(II) meso-tetra(4-pyridyl)porphyrin guest. The newly developed caged catalysts (Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 1)6, Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 2)6 and Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 3)6) can be easily synthesized and differ in exo-functionalization, which are either none, polar or apolar groups. This leads to a different polarity of the peripheral environment surrounding the cage, which affects the (relative) local concentration of the substrates surrounding the cage and hence indirectly influences the substrate availability of the catalysis embedded in the active site of the caged catalyst systems. The resulting increased local substrate concentrations give rise to higher catalytic activities of the respective caged catalyst in metalloradical catalyzed cyclopropanation reactions. Interestingly, the catalytic activity is the highest when the apolar cage catalyst (Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 1)6) is used, and lowest with the polar analog (Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 3)6). In addition, the catalytic activity of the cage without exo-functionalities (Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 2)6) is nearly two times lower than that of Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 1)6 and three times higher than that of Co-G@Fe8(Zn-L ⋅ 3)6, which further demonstrates the effect of the peripheral functionalities on the cyclopropanation reaction.",

            "abstract": "Adsorption of lindane (HCH) on nickel modified graphitic carbon nitride (Ni-gCN) was investigated using a novel, accurate and broadly parametrized self-consistent tight-binding quantum chemical (GFN2-xTB) method. Two graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) models were used: corrugated and planar, which represent the material with different thicknesses. Electronic properties of the adsorbates and adsorbent were estimated via vertical ionization potential, vertical electron affinity, global electrophilicity index and the HOMO and LUMO. Adsorption energy and population analyses were carried out to figure out the nature of the adsorption process. The results reveal that the introduction of the nickel atom significantly influences the electronic properties of gCN, and results in the improvement of adsorption ability of gCN for lindane. Lindane adsorption on Ni-gCN is considered as chemisorption, which is primarily supported by the interaction of the nickel atom and chlorine atoms of HCH. The effect of solvents (water, ethanol, acetonitrile) was investigated via the analytical linearized Poisson–Boltzmann model. Due to the strong chemisorption, Ni-gCN can collect lindane from different solvents. The adsorption configurations of HCH on Ni-gCN were also shown to be thermally stable at 298 K, 323 K, 373 K, 473 K, and 573 K via molecular simulation calculations. The obtained results are useful for a better understanding of lindane adsorption on Ni-gCN and for the design of materials with high efficiency for lindane treatment based on adsorption-photocatalytic technology.",

            "abstract": "Confinement of a catalyst can have a significant impact on catalytic performance and can lead to otherwise difficult to achieve catalyst properties. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel caged catalyst system Co−G@Fe8(Zn−L ⋅ 1)6, which is soluble in both polar and apolar solvents without the necessity of any post-functionalization. This is a rare example of a metal-coordination cage able to bind catalytically active porphyrins that is soluble in solvents spanning a wide variety of polarity. This system was used to investigate the combined effects of the solvent and the cage on the catalytic performance in the cobalt catalyzed cyclopropanation of styrene, which involves radical intermediates. Kinetic studies show that DMF has a protective influence on the catalyst, slowing down deactivation of both [Co(TPP)] and Co−G@Fe8(Zn−L ⋅ 1)6, leading to higher TONs in this solvent. Moreover, DFT studies on the [Co(TPP)] catalyst show that the rate determining energy barrier of this radical-type transformation is not influenced by the coordination of DMF. As such, the increased TONs obtained experimentally stem from the stabilizing effect of DMF and are not due to an intrinsic higher activity caused by axial ligand binding to the cobalt center ([Co(TPP)(L)]). Remarkably, encapsulation of Co−G led to a three times more active catalyst than [Co(TPP)] (TOFini) and a substantially increased TON compared to both [Co(TPP)] and free Co−G. The increased local concentration of the substrates in the hydrophobic cage compared to the bulk explains the observed higher catalytic activities.",

These polymers crystallized in the C2/m space group of the monoclinic crystal system, creating non-interpenetrated channels in one direction with an extraordinary solvent-accessible volume of 46 %. Unlike metal–organic rotaxane frameworks having benzylic amide macrocycles as linkers, the absence of the thread in these novel reticular materials causes a decrease of dimensionality and an improvement of pore size and dynamic guest adaptability. We studied the incorporation of fullerene C60 inside the adjustable pocket generated between two macrocycles connected to the same dinuclear clusters, occupying a remarkable 98 % of the cavities inside the network. The use of these materials as hosts for the selective recognition of different fullerenes was evaluated, mainly encapsulating the smaller size fullerene derivative in several mixtures of C60 and C70.",

            "abstract": "Mastering intermolecular gearing is crucial for the emergence of complex functional nanoscale machineries. However, achieving correlated motion within trains of molecular gears remains highly challenging, due to the multiple degrees of freedom of each cogwheel. In this context, we designed and synthesised a series of star-shaped organometallic molecular gears incorporating a hydrotris(indazolyl)borate anchor to prevent diffusion on the surface, a central ruthenium atom as a fixed rotation axis, and an azimuthal pentaporphyrinic cyclopentadienyl cogwheel specifically labelled to monitor its motion by non-time-resolved Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Desymmetrisation of the cogwheels was first achieved sterically, i.e. by introducing one tooth longer than the other four. For optimal mechanical interactions, chemical labelling was also investigated as a preferential way to induce local contrast in STM images, and the electronic properties of one single paddle were modulated by varying the porphyrinic scaffold or the nature of the central metal. To reach such a structural diversity, our modular synthetic approach relied on sequential cross-coupling reactions on a penta(p-halogenophenyl)cyclopentadienyl ruthenium(II) key building block, bearing a single pre-activated p-iodophenyl group. Chemoselective Sonogashira or more challenging Suzuki–Miyaura reactions allowed the controlled introduction of the tagged porphyrinic tooth, and the subsequent four-fold cross-couplings yielded the prototypes of pentaporphyrinic molecular gears for on-surface studies, incorporating desymmetrised cogwheels over 5 nm in diameter.",

            "abstract": "The analysis of ‘cutting’ or additive agents in cocaine, like benzocaine (BZC), allows police analysts to identify each component of the sample, thus obtaining information like the drugs’ provenience. This kind of drug profiling is of great value in tackling drug trafficking. Electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymers (e-MIPs) on portable screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) were developed in this study for BZC determination. The MIPs’ electropolymerization was performed on a carbon surface using the anaesthetic BZC as the template molecule and 3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-AHBA) as the functional monomer. The build-up of this biomimetic sensor was carefully characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and optimized. Cyclic voltammetric investigation demonstrated that BZC oxidation had a complex and pH-dependent mechanism, but at pH 7.4 a single, well-defined oxidation feature was observed. The BZC-MIP interactions were studied by computer-aided theoretical modeling by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The electroanalytical methodology was effectively applied to artificial urine samples; BZC molecular recognition was achieved with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 2.9 nmol L−1 employing square-wave voltammetry (SWV). The e-MIPs were then used to ‘fingerprint’ genuine cocaine samples, assisted by principal component analysis (PCA), at the central forensic laboratory of the Brazilian Federal Police (BFP) with a portable potentiostat. This electroanalysis provided proof-of-concept that the drugs could be voltammetrically ‘fingerprinted’ using e-MIPs supported by chemometric analysis.",

            "abstract": "3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) is a harmful and controlled synthetic cathinone used as a psychostimulant drug and as sport-enhancing substance. A sensor was developed for the direct analysis of MDPV by transducing its oxidation signal by means of an electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymer (e-MIP) built in-situ on the screen-printed carbon electrode’s (SPCE) surface previously covered with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Benzene-1,2-diamine was used as the functional monomer while the analyte was used as the template monomer. Each step of the sensor’s development was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a solution containing ferricyanide, however no redox probe was required for the actual MDPV measurements. The interaction between the poly(o-phenylenediamine) imprinted polymer and MDPV was studied by density-functional theory (DFT) methods. The SPCE-MWCNT-AgNP-MIP sensor responded adequately to the variation of MDPV concentration. It was shown that AgNPs enhanced the electrochemical signal by around a 3-fold factor. Making use of square-wave voltammetry (SWV) the developed sensor provided a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.8 μmol L–1. The analytical performance of the proposed sensor paves the way to the development of a portable device for MDPV on-site sensing to be applied in forensic and doping analysis.",

            "abstract": "Acid–base clusters and stable salt formation are critical drivers of new particle formation events in the atmosphere. In this study, we explore salt heterodimer (a cluster of one acid and one base) stability as a function of gas-phase acidity, aqueous-phase acidity, heterodimer proton transference, vapor pressure, dipole moment and polarizability for salts comprised of sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid and nitric acid with nine bases. The best predictor of heterodimer stability was found to be gas-phase acidity. We then analyzed the relationship between heterodimer stability and J4×4, the theoretically predicted formation rate of a four-acid, four-base cluster, for sulfuric acid salts over a range of monomer concentrations from 105 to 109 molec cm−3 and temperatures from 248 to 348 K and found that heterodimer stability forms a lognormal relationship with J4×4. However, temperature and concentration effects made it difficult to form a predictive expression of J4×4. In order to reduce those effects, heterodimer concentration was calculated from heterodimer stability and yielded an expression for predicting J4×4 for any salt, given approximately equal acid and base monomer concentrations and knowledge of monomer concentration and temperature. This parameterization was tested for the sulfuric acid–ammonia system by comparing the predicted values to experimental data and was found to be accurate within 2 orders of magnitude. We show that one can create a simple parameterization that incorporates the dependence on temperature and monomer concentration on J4×4 by defining a new term that we call the normalized heterodimer concentration, Φ. A plot of J4×4 vs. Φ collapses to a single monotonic curve for weak sulfate salts (difference in gas-phase acidity &gt;95 kcal mol−1) and can be used to accurately estimate J4×4 within 2 orders of magnitude in atmospheric models.",

The as-prepared DEMOF variants were designed to carry copper-ion vacancies and mixed-valence Cu1+/Cu2+ sites on the {220} and {111} planes of NR-HKUST-1 and {100}, {110} and {111} planes of NS-HKUST-1 via reversible and irreversible growth modes. The photocatalysis results indicate that the mixed-valence Cu1+/Cu2+ sites (with special electronic properties) in planar-type defective HKUST-1 have a greater effect on performance improvement than copper-ion vacancies (with special steric properties). The HOMO–LUMO gap of the Cu1+/Cu2+ unit is significantly reduced to promote the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and overcome the transfer resistance of electron–hole pairs, leading to an outstanding catalytic activity (3784.2 μmol g−1 h−1). This strategy of creating mixed-valence sites and vacancies by doping a reductive defect linker can provide a new way to prepare catalysts with higher photocatalytic activity.",

            "abstract": "Methylmercury is a highly toxic compound and human exposure is mainly related to consumption of polluted fish and seafood. The inactivation of thiol-based enzymes, promoted by the strong affinity binding of electrophilic mercuric ions to thiol and selenol groups of proteins, is likely an important factor explaining its toxicity. A key role is played by the chemistry and reactivity of the mercury–chalcogens bond, particularly HgS and HgSe, which is the focus of this computational work (level of theory: (COSMO)-ZORA-BLYP-D3(BJ)/TZ2P). We analyze nine ligand-exchange model reactions (the so-called Rabenstein's reactions) involving an entering ligand (methylchalcogenolate) and a substrate (methylchalcogenolatemethylmercury). Trends in reaction and activation energies are discussed and a change in mechanism is reported for all cases when going from gas phase to water, that is, from a single-well potential energy surface (PES) to a canonical SN2-like mechanism. The reasons accounting for the biochemically challenging and desired displacement of methylmercury from a seleno/thiol protein can be found already in these model reactions, as can be seen from the similarities of the ligand exchange reactions in solution in thermodynamics and kinetics.",

            "abstract": "Developing low-cost nonprecious catalysts to replace Pt-based material is of great significance and importance for high-performance energy devices. Designing highly efficient, stable, and economic oxygen reaction electrocatalysts with atomically-dispersed metal–N–C active sites through an effective strategy is highly desired for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Currently, the preparation of monoatomic catalysts with high loading and high activity, and the assurance of active sites fully exposed and participating in the reaction is challenging. Herein, atomically-dispersed Fe sites anchored to a porous carbon (Fe-SA/PC) hybrid synthesized via a facile dual-confinement route is reported. The experimental and theoretical simulations reveal that edge oxygen dopants facilitate the micropore trapping of the organic iron complex and the formation of isolated Fe atoms by subsequent pyrolysis. The optimized Fe-SA/PC catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V, which is superior to most of the reported single-atom catalysts. DFT calculations proved that Fe–Nx sites with carbon defects can synergistically reduce the reaction barriers as compared to the intact Fe–Nx atomic configuration. This work provides a promising strategy for the design and construction of a series of high performance single-atom catalysts.",

These ligands self-assemble into dinuclear cyclic metallosupramolecular aggregates upon coordination to [(dppp)Pd(OTf)2] in a highly diastereoselective manner, by heterochiral self-sorting in a chiral self-discriminating manner as shown by ESI mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and single crystal XRD analysis. This observation is in contrast to earlier studies with ligands derived from Tröger's base that have larger metal binding motifs and bis(nitrile) and bis(isonitrile) ligands based on other rigid dissymmetric cores such as [2.2]paracyclophanes. Thus, the combination of these slim metal binding motifs with the rigid v-shaped 2,8- or 3,9-disubstituted Tröger's base scaffolds seems to be especially well preorganized to ensure high-fidelity social self-sorting behavior.",

These clam-shaped entities have been studied experimentally by Abrahams, Robson, and co-workers [B. F. Abrahams, N. J. FitzGerald, T. A. Hudson, R. Robson and T. Waters, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2009, 48, 3129–3132] where the capsules acted as an excellent host for large alkali-metal cations. In this study, we present a detailed analysis based on accurate dispersion-corrected Density Functional Theory approaches that reveals the factors that stabilise such CTC-based capsules at different protonation states and their interaction with various encapsulated guests. Our results show that the capsules’ overall stability results as an interplay of hydrogen bonding, London dispersion, and electrostatic effects. The most stable capsules with group-1 and group-2 cations as guests contain only six phenolic hydrogens, as opposed to the maximum possible number of twelve. Inclusion of larger alkali-metal cations is favoured due to larger London-dispersion contributions. Cations are favoured as guests over isoelectronic neutral species, as the resulting host-guest complexes experience additional stability due to cooperative effects. In fact, using the latter to drive the formation of specific capsules could be used in future strategies aimed at synthesising similar aggregates; our results provide an insightful understanding and useful guidance for such future endeavours.",

In this work, we compared oxidized carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, oxidized carbon nanohorns and oxidized graphitized carbon black, as scaffolds for magnetized nanocomposites. The nanomaterials were extensively characterized with experimental and in silico techniques. Next, they were applied to phosphopeptide enrichment from cancer cell lysates for NanoHPLC-MS/MS, with selectivity as high as nearly 90% and several-thousand identification hits. Overall, new insights emerged for the understanding and the design of nanocomposites for phosphoproteomics.",

While its understanding has recently made tremendous progress, its general appreciation is still lagging behind electrostatics. This can be explained by the simple tools available to study electrostatic interactions, such as electrostatic potential (ESP) maps and partial charges, and a lack thereof for dispersion. We herein report a universal quantitative descriptor of dispersion interaction potentials, which allows assessing dispersion visually by London dispersion potential (LDP) maps, and quantitatively using the average LDP on the van der Waals surface. We demonstrate the utility of these new tools by constructing a quantitative dispersion energy scale of the elements and common substituents, studying non-covalent interactions (NCIs), and developing modern linear free energy relationships in catalysis.",

The study is based on DFT calculations with a double hybrid functional and an implicit solvent model. It shows that iodine is less effective than bromine in the oxidation of Li2O2 to oxygen. On the basis of our thermodynamic data, in solvents with a low dielectric constant, iodine does not spontaneously promote either the oxidation of Li2O2 or the release of singlet oxygen, while bromine could spontaneously trigger both events. When a solvent with a large dielectric constant is used, both halogens appear to be able, at least on the basis of thermodynamics, to react spontaneously with the oxides, and the ensuing reaction sequence turned out to be strongly exoergic, thereby providing a route for the release of significant amounts of singlet oxygen. The role of spin–orbit coupling in providing a mechanism for singlet–triplet intersystem crossing has also been assessed.",

The study of many MOFs requires periodic calculations. However, isolated models have also been employed in first-principles calculations to study their mechanisms and energy profiles. Following the water adsorption properties of MOF building units, this study determines how far isolated models of MOFs can reproduce experimental observations and where they fail. According to our DFT simulations of water adsorption by 70 common metal nodes and over 110 organic linkers, the isolated models provide some opportunities and limitations. They indicate the water adsorption mechanism and energy of the individual MOF components. They give clues about the water stability of the metal nodes and the degradation pathways. Also, they predict an overall trend for the maximum water uptake capacity. However, they cannot always give an accurate insight into MOF’s water adsorption enthalpies, their water harvesting efficiency, their water uptake capacities under varying conditions, and a complete picture of the water uptake mechanism inside MOF pores.",

Atropoisomeric (S)-TetraMe-BITIANP (L1) and (S)-BITIANP (L2), together with ligands bearing mixed chirality as in (S,S,Sax)-DIOPHEP (L3), (R,Rax)-ISAPHOS C1 (L4) and (S,Rax,Rax)-ISAPHOS C2 (L5), and the ones containing a stereogenic sp3 carbon ((R,R)-ZEDPHOS (L6) and (R,R)-EPHOS (L8) and their derivatives L7 and L9) have been employed as a source of chirality in rhodium complexes. Among this last class of diphosphines, the new phosphorus-based ligand called (R,R)-EPHOS (L8) has been synthesized and employed for the first time as a chiral ligand in rhodium complexes for its catalytic activity. Computational studies suggested a cis coordination with a wide bite angle. When applied to the asymmetric conjugate addition of phenyl boronic acid to 3-azaarylpropenone 1, the catalytic system bearing L8 afforded the product 1a in a remarkable 94% e.e. in THF.",

Understanding peptide conformation in both free and protein-bound states remains one of the most critical areas for successful development of peptide drugs. In this study it was demonstrated that the combination of Size-Exclusion Chromatography with Hydrogen–Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (SEC-HDX-MS) and Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy (CD) can be used to guide the selection of peptides for further NMR analysis. Moreover, the insights from this workflow guide the choice of the best biologically relevant conditions for NMR conformational studies of peptide ligands in a free state in solution. Combined information about solution conformation character and stability across temperatures and co-solvent compositions greatly expedites selection of optimal conditions for NMR analysis. In total, the combination of SEC-HDX-MS, CD, and NMR into a single complementary workflow greatly accelerates conformational analysis of peptides in the drug discovery lead optimization process.",

Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) calculations are extremely useful in computational studies of these interactions because they provide very detailed information about the strengths and types of molecular interactions. QTAIM also provides information about the intramolecular changes that occur in the catalytic reaction. Here, we analyze the enzyme–substrate interactions and the topological properties of the electron density in the enantioselective step of the acylation of (R,S)-propranolol, an aminoalcohol with therapeutic applications, catalyzed by Candida antarctica lipase B. Eight reaction paths (four for each enantiomer) are investigated and the energies, atomic charges, hydrogen bonds, and n → π* interactions of propranolol, the catalytic triad (composed of D187, H224, and S105), and the oxyanion hole are analyzed. It is found that D187 acts as an electron density reservoir for H224, and H224 acts as an electron density reservoir for the active site of the protein. It releases electron density when the tetrahedral intermediate is formed from the Michaelis complex and receives it when the enzyme–product complex is formed. Hydrogen bonds can be grouped into noncovalent and covalent hydrogen bonds. The latter are stronger and more important for the reaction than the former. We also found weak n → π* interactions, which are characterized by QTAIM and the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis.",

In the present work, we provide a general strategy for the rational design of molecular single-atom catalyst in the form of nickel phthalocyanine@nanocarbon (NiPc@NC) for highly efficient electroreduction of CO2 to CO. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations and state-of-the-art electronic structure analysis to explore the mechanism and substituent effects on structural stability, redox chemistry, adsorption properties, and molecule–substrate interactions of the NiPc catalyst. We have revealed that the electron-withdrawing groups facilitate the reductive activation of the catalytic Ni center but weaken the Ni–N bond strength and make the CO desorption sluggish, while the electron-donating groups do the opposite. A substituent-dependent correlation between interaction strength and electron transfer through the interface is also revealed by noncovalent interaction analysis and electron density difference projection. On the basis of the gained insights, we apply semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) calculation, machine learning (ML), and genetic algorithm (GA) to screening through the chemical space of ca. 10 trillion substituted NiPc molecules under a descriptor scheme to identify promising molecular candidates for the NiPc@NC hybrid material. The best candidate from GA search outperforms the state-of-the-art catalyst in terms of stability, reduction potential (improved by 110 mV), and interaction with substrate (strengthened by 0.46 eV). Design strategies are proposed based on the top-scoring molecules from computational screening, and the workflow is highly generalizable and transferable to similar molecular systems for other applications.",

            "abstract": "The ab initio determination of electronic excited state (ES) properties is the cornerstone of theoretical photochemistry. Yet, traditional ES methods become impractical when applied to fairly large molecules, or when used on thousands of systems. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated their accuracy at retrieving ES properties of large molecular databases at a reduced computational cost. For these applications, nonlinear algorithms tend to be specialized in targeting individual properties. Learning fundamental quantum objects potentially represents a more efficient, yet complex, alternative as a variety of molecular properties could be extracted through postprocessing. Herein, we report a general framework able to learn three fundamental objects: the hole and particle densities, as well as the transition density. We demonstrate the advantages of targeting those outputs and apply our predictions to obtain properties, including the state character and the exciton topological descriptors, for the two bands (nπ* and ππ*) of 3427 azoheteroarene photoswitches.",

            "abstract": "Although transition metal silicates are recognized as high potential and attractive materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their efficient energy storage, earth-abundance without pollution, low cost, and easy preparation, however, the unstable electrochemical stability originating from the intrinsic mechanism involved in long-term cycling tests is always of concern and needs to be decoupled stepwise. Herein, a strategy is proposed to overcome the challenges through the construction of a heterostructure using a facile hydrothermal method in combination with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the composite. By tailoring a capacitive contribution over diffusion toward total charge storage in the heterostructure, CNT-coated heterostructural copper–nickel silicates (CNT@NiCuSi) were employed as the anode to achieve a relatively high capacity (412 mAh g–1 at 0.2 A g–1) and prolonged life for durable LIBs (91% retention after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g–1). The heterostructure generated by NiSi/CuSi could lower the polarization of the composite and elevate its cycle stability, rendering the metal silicate favorable for LIBs. As a consequence, the practical application is evaluated by assembling a full cell based on CNT@NiCuSi as the anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) as the cathode yielding a reversible capacity of 429 mAh g–1, along with a decent capacity retention of 221 mAh g–1 at a current density of 0.5 A g–1 after 300 cycles. This strategy opens an avenue for constructing long-life metal silicate-based nanocomposites for LIBs.",

            "abstract": "To gain more insight into the physicochemical aspects of a protein structure from the first principles, conformational space of all 8000 “capped” tripeptides (i.e., N-Ac-X1X2X3-NH-CH3, where Xi is one of the 20 natural amino acids) was investigated computationally. An enormous dataset (denoted P-CONF_1.6M and containing close to 1 600 000 conformers in total) has been obtained by employing a composite protocol combining density functional theory, semiempirical quantum mechanics (SQM), and state-of-the-art solvation methods with 1000 K molecular dynamics (MD) used to generate initial structures (200 snapshots for each tripeptide). This allowed us to present the first rigorous QM-based glimpse at the vast conformational space spanned by small protein fragments. The same computational procedure was repeated for tripeptide fragments taken from the SCOPe database of three-dimensional protein folds, by restraining them to their geometry in a protein. Such complementary data allowed us to compare the distribution of conformational strain energies of unrestrained tripeptidic fragments “in solvent” with those in existing protein chains. Besides providing a rigorous (ab initio) proof of a few well-known concepts and hypotheses concerning protein structures, such as the distribution of (φ, ψ) angles in Ramachandran plots, we have made several observations that came as a certain surprise: (1) distribution of conformational energies does not significantly differ between the “unbiased/unrestrained” conformers obtained from MD sampling in solvent and the biased conformers, i.e., those of a given tripeptide obtained from protein structures; (2) conformational (strain) energy window up to ∼20 to 25 kcal·mol–1 is readily available to tripeptide fragments within the context of a protein chain; (3) overpopulation in certain regions of Ramachandran plot was observed for the unbiased conformers. Last but not least, the massive dataset of accurate (DFT-D3//COSMO-RS) conformational (free) energies of ∼1.6 M peptide conformers, P-CONF_1.6M, obtained throughout this work may serve as excellent dataset for calibrating and benchmarking of popular force fields.",

For this purpose, cationic dimeric Rh(I) complex [(Rh(1))2Cl]SbF6 and cationic monomeric Rh(I) complex [RhOH2(2)]SbF6 were synthesized from oxazolidinone-substituted 3-phenylnorbornadiene ligands 1 and 2, which differ in the substitution pattern at oxazolidinone C-5′ (CMe2 vs CH2) and compared with the corresponding neutral dimeric and monomeric Rh(I) complexes [RhCl(1)]2 and [RhCl(2)]. Structural, electronic, and mechanistic insights were gained by X-ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry (CV), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and DFT calculations. CV revealed an increased stability of cationic vs neutral Rh complexes toward oxidation. Comparison of solid-state and solution XAS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES)) data showed that the monomeric Rh complex [RhCl(2)] maintained its electronic state and coordination sphere in solution, whereas the dimeric Rh complex [RhCl(1)]2 exchanges bridging chloro ligands by dioxane molecules in solution. In both 1,2- and 1,4-addition reactions, monomeric Rh complexes [RhCl(2)] and [RhOH2(2)]SbF6 gave better yields as compared to dimeric complexes [RhCl(1)]2 and [(Rh(1))2Cl]SbF6. Regarding enantioselectivities, dimeric Rh species [RhCl(1)]2 and [(Rh(1))2Cl]SbF6 performed better than monomeric Rh species in the 1,2-addition, while the opposite was true for the 1,4-addition. Neutral Rh complexes performed better than cationic complexes. Microemulsions improved the yields of 1,2-additions due to a most probable enrichment of Rh complexes in the amphiphilic film and provided a strong influence of the complex nuclearity and charge on the stereocontrol. A strong nonlinear-like effect (NLLE) was observed in 1,2-additions, when diastereomeric mixtures of ligands 1 and epi-1 were employed. The pronounced substrate dependency of the 1,4-addition could be rationalized by DFT calculations.",

            "abstract": "Electro- and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (e-HER and p-HER) are two promising strategies to produce green hydrogen fuel from water. High intrinsic activity, sufficient active sites, fast charge-transfer capacity, and good optoelectronic properties must be taken into consideration simultaneously in pursuit of an ideal bifunctional catalyst. Here, platinum atomic clusters embedded in defects of TiO2 nanocrystals/graphene nanosheets (Pt–T/G) are reported as a bifunctional catalyst for electro- and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (e-HER and p-HER). High activity is delivered due to the charge transfer from the other part of the catalyst to the active center (Pt2–O4–Tix), decreasing the activation energy of the rate-limiting step, which is revealed by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical measurements, and simulated calculations. In regard to e-HER, it outperforms the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C catalyst by a factor of 17.5 on Pt mass basis, allowing for a 93% reduction in Pt loadings. In regard to p-HER, it achieves photocatalytic efficiency (686.8 μmol h–1) without any attenuation in 9 h.",

            "abstract": "By computing strain energies of peptide fragments within protein structures and their intramolecular interaction energies, we attempt to reveal general biophysical trends behind the secondary structure formation in the context of protein evolution. Our “protein basis set” consisted of 1143 representatives of different folds obtained from curated SCOPe database, and for each member of the set, the strain and intramolecular energy was calculated on the “rolling tripeptide” basis, employing the DFT-D3/COSMO-RS method for the former and the QM-calibrated force field method (MM) for the latter. The calculated data, strain and interactions, were correlated with the conservation of amino acid residues in secondary structure elements and also with the level of the residue burial within the protein three-dimensional structure. It allowed us to formulate several observations concerning fundamental differences between two main secondary structure motifs: α-helices and β-strands. We have shown that a strong interaction is one of the determining characteristics of the β-sheet formation, at least at the level of tripeptides (and likely penta- or heptapeptides, too), and that the β-strand is a prevailing secondary structure in the strongly-interacting regions of the protein folds conserved by evolution. On the other hand, low strain was neither proven to be an important physicochemical property conserved by evolution nor does it correlate with the propensity for the α-helix and β-strand. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the strong interaction has a certain level of connection with residue burial; however, we demonstrate that these two characteristics should be rather regarded as two complementary factors. These findings represent an important contribution to understanding protein folding from first principles, which is a complementary approach to ongoing efforts to solve the protein folding problem by knowledge-based approaches and machine-learning.",

The metallomacrocycle scaffold that contains negatively and positively charged subunits can further self-assemble owing to a competition between the solvation energy of the discrete species and intermolecular electrostatic interactions. When the dissociating character of the solvent was lowered or when in the presence of a protic solvent, different types of multiscale organizations (vesicles and pseudo-1D structures) were selectively formed and were characterized by SAXS and transmission electron microscopy.",

            "abstract": "Synergistic experimental and theoretical studies have allowed the disentangling of the possible pathways for the supramolecular polymerization of a series of dicyanovinyl-bridged N-heterotriangulene (NHT) derivatives bearing benzamide units with achiral (1a) and chiral (1b,c) side chains. The synthesis of these bowl-shaped, self-assembling units yields a mixture of monomeric species with C3- and C1-symmetry. Both monomeric species are able to self-assemble into different supramolecular aggregates with sufficient stability to coexist in freshly prepared solutions. The dissimilar ratio of the aggregates initially generated results in different spectroscopic features and, more specifically, in the apparition of nonmirror circular dichroism (CD) spectra for chiral 1b and 1c. The interconversion at room temperature of the aggregates formed by the C3- and C1-symmetry monomeric species is energetically unfavorable due to the steric hindrance between the neighboring dicyanovinyl groups within the aggregate. Heating the aggregates constituted by both monomeric species favors their disassembly and, at the same time, the conversion of the monomeric species with C1-symmetry into that with C3-symmetry by a flipping motion of one dicyanovinyl group. Cooling down the solutions back to room temperature leads to the formation of helical-like columnar aggregates based on C3-symmetry monomers showing specular CD spectra for chiral 1b and 1c. The flipping motion at the molecular level described here for the bowl-shaped dicyanovinyl-bridged NHTs 1a–c is, to the best of our knowledge, the only example in which a geometric change in the monomeric species, with no participation of intramolecular noncovalent interactions, is responsible for biasing the pathway complexity that yields two different stable supramolecular architectures from a single self-assembling unit.",

Simple design of monomer structures not only overcomes the inherent selectivity limitation of enzyme used, but also achieves totally isotactic polyester products. By crystallizing the mixed enantiopure isotactic polyesters in different solvents, the formation of amorphous mixture, homocrystallites or stereocomplex crystallites were observed, respectively. This study is expected to open up a new way to prepare various stereocomplex polyesters containing a long-chain aliphatic alcohol backbone and a wide variety of functional groups.",

CL-20 in these complexes was surrounded by methyl, nitro, and amino derivatives of 4-nitropyrazole. The influence of substituents on the molecular electrostatic potential distribution of nitropyrazoles was investigated to figure out the potential electrostatic interaction sites. For the complex, the O···H hydrogen bond was popular in the intermolecular interactions, and dispersion interaction played an essential role, especially in Cx/CL-20 multimolecular complexes. Trigger bond analysis showed that their strength increased upon the formation of intermolecular weak interactions. Nitro group charge calculations stated that the negative charge on almost all nitro groups showed a significant increase. Therefore, the sensitivity of CL-20 seemed to be lower than the original. In addition, the transfer of electron density between CL-20 and nitropyrzoles in complexes was investigated, revealing the influence of weak interactions on the electron density of CL-20.",

The extract was obtained from the fruit seeds by the Soxhlet extraction method. The CHFE demonstrated promising anticorrosive performance, and the inhibition efficiency increased with increasing the concentration of the extract, peaking at 93% at only 500 ppm. Importantly, the inhibitor exhibited a remarkable stability after 48 h of immersion, reaching an efficiency of 94%. The extract revealed a mixed-type inhibitive behavior. In addition, elevating the solution temperature showed a negative influence on the inhibition efficacy. Thermodynamic parameters suggested that the steel dissolution is an endothermic, spontaneous process. In addition, the experimental findings match well with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and physisorption of the extract prevails. Furthermore, SEM/EDX and UV-Vis analyses demonstrated that the steel surface is protected by the extract molecules, confirming the electrochemical results. Density functional theory (DFT), Fukui function and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations unraveled the nature of inhibitor—metal surface interactions and provided insights into the most favorable electrophilic and nucleophilic active sites of oleic acid, a major constituent of the extract, helping to elucidate the mechanism of corrosion inhibition at the molecular level.",

Our calculations revealed that there are three different lowest-energy structures with C2v, C3v, and Td symmetries for TM@C28. The HOMO–LUMO gap of all these structures ranges from 1.35 eV to 2.31 eV, in which [V@C28]+ has the lowest HOMO–LUMO gap of 1.35 eV. The molecular orbitals are mainly composed of fullerene cage orbitals and slightly encapsulated metal orbitals. The bonding analysis on the metal–cage interactions reveals they are dominated by the Coulomb term ΔEelstat and the orbital interaction term ΔEorb, in which the orbital interaction term ΔEorb contributes more than the Coulomb term ΔEelstat. The addition of one or two CF3 groups to [V@C28]+ could increase the HOMO–LUMO gap and further increase the stability of [V@C28]+.",

The trimer has a prismatic structure with negatively curved side walls, which promote the formation of supramolecular organic frameworks stabilized by dispersion interactions. The first framework type, UWr-1, has the npo topology, with a hexagonal structure analogous to the Schwartz H triply periodic minimal surface. Co-crystallization of the trimer with either C60 and C70 produces the isomorphous cubic UWr-2 and UWr-3 phases, characterized by the ctn network topology and a structural relationship to the Fischer-Koch minimal surface S. All three phases contain complex labyrinths of solvent-filled channels, corresponding to very large probe-accessible volumes (68 % to 76 %). The UWr-2 network could be partly desolvated while retaining its long range dimensional order, indicating remarkable strength of the dispersion interactions in the crystal. A theoretical analysis of noncovalent interactions shows the role of geometrical matching between the negatively curved porphyrin units and positively curved fullerenes.",

Results showed the total phenolic and flavonoids contents, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), scavenging capacities against 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radicals, as well as inhibitory abilities against α-amylase and α-glucosidase of pomelo peel were increased and fermentation for 8 days was the best. Additionally, the fermented sample could also enhance the glucose consumption and glycogen of HepG2 cell. Based on UPLC-MS/MS analysis, binding energy calculation, concentration determination and IC50 measurement, purpurin, apigenin, genistein, and paxilline could be concluded to be the main compounds to enhance the inhibition activities of fermented sample against α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Furthermore, computational studies were performed to reveal the the binding site and molecular interactions between paxilline and α-amylase, as well as purpurin and α-glucosidase. These findings provide a base for the utilization and valorization of pomelo peels as functional food additives by fermentation.",

            "abstract": "The persistence and potential toxicity of emergent pollutants pose significant threats to biodiversity and human health, emphasizing the need for sensors capable of detecting these pollutants at extremely low concentrations before treatment. This study focuses on the development of glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) modified by films of poly-tris(4-(4-(carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)silanol (PTPTCzSiOH), poly-4,4′-Di(carbazol-9-yl)-1,1′-biphenyl (PCBP), and poly-1,3,5-tri(carbazol-9-yl)benzene (PTCB) for the detection of metronidazole (MNZ) in aqueous media. The films were characterized using electrochemical, microscopy, and spectroscopy techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Monomers were electropolymerized through cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. Computational methods at the B3LYP/def2-TZVP level were employed to investigate the structural and electrochemical properties of the monomers. The electrochemical detection of MNZ utilized the linear sweep voltammetry technique. Surface characterization through SEM and XPS confirmed the proper electrodeposition of polymer films. Notably, MPN-GCEs exhibited higher detection signals compared to bare GCEs up to 3.6 times in the case of PTPTCzSiOH-GCEs. This theoretical study provides insights into the structural, chemical, and electronic properties of the polymers. The findings suggest that polymer-modified GCEs hold promise as candidates for the development of electrochemical sensors.",

            "abstract": "Cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) were incorporated into a superabsorbent hydrogel of starch grafted with poly(acrylic acid) (ST-g-PAAc) to obtain adsorbent materials with superior performance for Pb(II) removal from water. Herein, various experimental and theoretical analyses were conducted to highlight and elucidate the contribution of CNWs to the adsorption process. The presence of 10 wt% CNWs in the hydrogel led to an approximately 12% increase in the adsorption capacity of Pb(II) compared to the hydrogel without CNWs. Indeed, 25 mg of composite hydrogel required a short contact time (60 min) to achieve high adsorption capacities (935.8 mg/g). It was demonstrated that CNWs in the composite matrix also mitigate the effects of temperature and competition with other ions, enhancing the stability, selectivity, and efficiency of the Pb(II) adsorption.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the hydroxyl groups of CNWs play a crucial role by providing additional binding energies (30 kcal/mol) for Pb(II) ions, favoring the spontaneity and kinetics of the adsorption process. Kinetic and isothermal investigations revealed that the adsorption process on the CNW-containing hydrogel involves chemisorption and intra-particle diffusion, indicating multiple steps during the adsorption of Pb(II) ions. Furthermore, the CNW-containing hydrogel demonstrated excellent reusability, with only an 8% loss in adsorption capacity after six consecutive reuses. This characteristic makes the composite hydrogel highly attractive for practical applications in real-world scenarios. In summary, the experimental and theoretical data collected in this study confirm the superior adsorption performance of the composite hydrogel due to the presence of CNWs.",

            "abstract": "Polarization and charge transfer strongly characterize the ligand-receptor interaction when metal atoms are present, as for the Au(I)-biscarbene/DNA G-quadruplex complexes. In a previous work (J Comput Aided Mol Des2022, 36, 851–866) we used the ab initio FMO2 method at the RI-MP2/6-31G* level of theory with the PCM [1] solvation approach to calculate the binding energy (ΔEFMO) of two Au(I)-biscarbene derivatives, [Au(9-methylcaffein-8-ylidene)2]+ and [Au(1,3-dimethylbenzimidazole-2-ylidene)2]+, able to interact with DNA G-quadruplex motif. We found that ΔEFMO and ligand-receptor pair interaction energies (EINT) show very large negative values making the direct comparison with experimental data difficult and related this issue to the overestimation of the embedded charge transfer energy between fragments containing metal atoms. In this work, to improve the accuracy of the FMO method for predicting the binding affinity of metal-based ligands interacting with DNA G-quadruplex (Gq), we assess the effect of the following computational features: (i) the electron correlation, considering the Hartree–Fock (HF) and a post-HF method, namely RI-MP2; (ii) the two (FMO2) and three-body (FMO3) approaches; (iii) the basis set size (polarization functions and double-ζ vs. triple-ζ) and (iv) the embedding electrostatic potential (ESP). Moreover, the partial screening method was systematically adopted to simulate the solvent screening effect for each calculation. We found that the use of the ESP computed using the screened point charges for all atoms (ESP-SPTC) has a critical impact on the accuracy of both ΔEFMO and EINT, eliminating the overestimation of charge transfer energy and leading to energy values with magnitude comparable with typical experimental binding energies. With this computational approach, EINT values describe the binding efficiency of metal-based binders to DNA Gq more accurately than ΔEFMO. Therefore, to study the binding process of metal containing systems with the FMO method, the adoption of partial screening solvent method combined with ESP-SPCT should be considered. This computational protocol is suggested for FMO calculations on biological systems containing metals, especially when the adoption of the default ESP treatment leads to questionable results.",

Both modifications are close to known metal binding sites, so as well as each modified peptide we also study Cu(II) bound to N-terminal and C-terminal residues. We show that A53T is predicted to cause increased β-sheet content of the peptide, with a persistent β-hairpin between residues 35–55 particularly notable. Phosphorylation has less effect on secondary structure but is predicted to significantly increase the size of the peptide, especially when bound to Cu(II), which is ascribed to reduced interaction of C-terminal sequence with central non-amyloid component. In addition, estimate of binding free energy to Cu(II) indicates A53T has little effect on metal-ion affinity, whereas phosphorylation markedly enhances the strength of binding. We suggest that the predicted changes in spatial extent and secondary structure of α-Synuclein may have implications for aggregation into Lewy bodies.",

Our experimental comparison between two aflatoxins with similar structures (AFB1 and AFG2) shows significant differences in laccase-mediated detoxification. A multi-scale modeling approach (Docking, Molecular Dynamics, and Density Functional Theory) identifies the highly substrate-specific changes required to improve laccase detoxifying performance. We employ a large-scale density functional theory-based approach, involving more than 7000 atoms, to identify the amino acid residues that determine the affinity of laccase for aflatoxins. From this study we conclude: (1) AFB1 is more challenging to degrade, to the point of complete degradation stalling; (2) AFG2 is easier to degrade by laccase due to its lack of side products and favorable binding dynamics; and (3) ample opportunities to optimize laccase for aflatoxin degradation exist, especially via mutations leading to π–π stacking. This study identifies a way to optimize laccase for aflatoxin bioremediation and, more generally, contributes to the research efforts aimed at rational enzyme optimization.",

            "abstract": "Metastable-state merocyanine photoacids (MCHs) have been widely applied to various chemical, material and biomedical areas to drive or control chemical processes with light. In this work, stoichiometry and association constants have been determined for inclusion complexes of a photoacid MCH1 ((E)-3-(2-(2-hydroxystyryl)-3,3-dimethyl-3H-indol-1-ium-1-yl)propane-1-sulfonate) with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), 2-hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD), γ-CD and HP-γ-CD by means of UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic titrations. The inclusion complexes were studied to enhance acidity and chemical stability. Kinetic study showed that CDs stabilized the acidic metastable state and slowed its thermal relaxation. The acidity of the ground and metastable state (pKaGS and pKaMS) increased upon addition of CDs. The pKaMS of [MCH1 ⋅ (γ-CD)2] is as low as 0.92 in comparison with 2.24 for MCH1, which is close to the lowest pKaMS values (1.20 and 1.03) reported previously, in which case the MCH1 was structurally modified with alkylammonium side chains. Addition of CDs also significantly enhanced the chemical stability of MCH1 against hydrolysis, which is one of the major concerns for the application of MCHs. In particular, the addition of HP-β-CD increased the half-life of MCH1 in aqueous solution more than four-fold. Moreover, the quantum chemical calculations confirmed the stoichiometry and analyzed the binding sites and hydrogen bonds of the inclusion complexes.",

All the synthesized samples were characterized using x-ray diffraction analysis which confirms the predominant presence of montmorillonite in all the samples thus confirming successful formation of bentonite. Similarly, EDX analysis confirms successful incorporation of Zn and Co in Ben sample. The analysis of the dielectric properties of the produced samples was successfully carried out, and the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss was explored. According to the results, all the samples exhibit considerable dielectric dispersion at lower frequencies, whereas steady dielectric constant and modest dielectric loss are shown at higher frequencies. The effect of Zn, Co incorporation and temperature dependence of dielectric behaviour of all the samples was also analysed and it was observed that at low temperatures undoped Ben samples showed high dielectric constant while as at higher temperatures the incorporation of Zn and Co enhances the dielectric constant of as prepared sample. Similarly, the variation of conductivity of as prepared samples with frequency and temperature was analysed and it was observed that all the samples show similar conduction behaviour and follows correlated barrier hopping type of conduction. The real and imaginary part of electric modulus as a function of frequency was also analysed. Further, theoretical analysis showed considerable change in HUMO and LUMO which is considered as a main reason responsible for change in dielectric characteristics of Ben and Zn/Co incorporated samples. From this study it was observed that the incorporation of metal ions into the layered bentonite improved the dielectric properties at high temperature thus this study provides a new insight into the development of new dielectric materials which could be used under high temperature operation conditions.",

It is shown here that the paramagnetic properties of the metals in lanthanide-capped cyclodextrins (Ln-α-CDs and Ln-β-CDs) are a convenient NMR indicator for different populations of host–guest complexes in a given solution. The paramagnetic guest exchange saturation transfer (paraGEST) method was used to study the exchange dynamics in systems composed of Ln-α-CDs or Ln-β-CDs with fluorinated guests, revealing multiple co-existing populations of host-guest complexes exclusively in solutions containing Ln-β-CDs. The enhanced spectral resolution of paraGEST, achieved by a strong pseudo contact shift induction, revealed that different molecular guests can adopt multiple orientations within Ln-β-CDs' cavities and, in contrast, only a single orientation inside Ln-α-CDs. Thus, paraGEST, which can significantly improve NMR detectability and spectral resolution of host-guest systems that experience fast exchange dynamics, is a convenient tool for studying supramolecular systems of metal-capped molecular hosts.",

            "abstract": "C-Glycosyl-flavonoids are phytochemical natural products that possess different biological applications. Several compounds from this class exhibit rotational isomerism, evidenced by NMR signal duplication. This phenomenon is usually associated with the restricted rotation of the C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond in the sugar-aglycone, however the reasons for its occurrence remain underexplored and demand further investigation. Herein, we conducted a DFT (B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(d,p)/IEFPCM) investigation to elucidate the origin of rotational isomerism in a diverse set of C-glycosyl-flavonoids, including isoschaftoside (1), schaftoside (2), vitexin (3), puerarin (4), and prunetin-8-C-glucoside (5), rationally chosen to understand the substituent effects in different positions in the flavonoid backbone. Our outcomes reveal that the rotation around the sugar-aglycone bond at the 8-C position of the flavonoid moiety has the most energetic barrier, although the value is not sufficient to induce NMR signal duplication (ΔG‡ = 14.5 ± 0.5 kcal mol−1). Only by simulating the solvent molecules explicitly, using a hybrid cluster-continuum model, we were able to identify the occurrence of rotational isomerism, revealing that the flavonoid–solvent interactions play an important role to the NMR signal duplication. The calculated rotational barriers range from 17.3 to 20.9 kcal mol−1, which is sufficient to cause bond hindrance rotation and identification of NMR double signals due to slow interconversion between the rotamers.",

MO/CS) were fabricated with the solution cast method. FTIR, SEM, and XRD spectra were used to study the structural features of those nanocomposite films. The FTIR spectra of chitosan showed the main characteristic peaks that are usually present, but they were shifted considerably by the chemical interaction with metal oxides. FTIR analysis of the hybrid chitosan-CoO nanocomposite exhibited notable peaks at 558 and 681 cm−1. Conversely, the FTIR analysis of the chitosan-SrO composite displayed peaks at 733.23 cm−1, 810.10 cm−1, and 856.39 cm−1, which can be attributed to the bending vibrations of Co-O and Sr-O bonds, respectively. In addition, the SEM graphs showed a noticeable morphological change on the surface of chitosan, which may be due to surface adsorption with metal oxide nanoparticles. The XRD pattern also revealed a clear change in the crystallinity of chitosan when it is in contact with metal oxide nanoparticles. The presence of characteristic signals for cobalt (Co) and strontium (Sr) are clearly shown in the EDX examinations, providing convincing evidence for their incorporation into the chitosan matrix. Moreover, the stability of the nanoparticle-chitosan coordinated bonding was verified from the accurate and broadly parametrized semi-empirical tight-binding quantum chemistry calculation. This leads to the determination of the structures’ chemical hardness as estimated from the frontier’s orbital calculations. We characterized the dielectric properties in terms of the real and imaginary dielectric permittivity as a function of frequency. Dielectric findings reveal the existence of extensive interactions of CoO and SrO, more pronounced for SrO, with the functional groups of CS through coordination bonding. This induces the charge transfer of the complexes between CoO and SrO and the CS chains and a decrease in the amount of the crystalline phase, as verified from the XRD patterns.",

            "abstract": "Triphenylamine derivatives (TPAs) are organic functional materials well known for their semiconducting charge transport and redox properties. These features characterize their applications in the field of organic electronics, for instance as hole transport layers for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs), as well as organic cathodes for electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices (e.g. organic batteries). Despite a large number of experimental and computational investigations, some structure–property relationships still remain elusive. Here, we explore through a bottom-up computational approach the molecular and solid state structures, as well as the charge transport processes in amorphous and single crystalline phases of four different redox active TPAs, characterized by increased molecular structure complexity. The TPAs considered feature one-, two- or four redox centers, namely (i) a single TPA unit, two TPAs linked via (ii) a flexible diphenyl bridge (TPD) or (iii) a rigid fluorene bridge (FTPD), and (iv) four TPAs connected via a spiro-center (spiro-OMeTAD). A combination of density functional theory, semiempirical and molecular dynamics methods is used to analyse the experimental crystalline structures, to generate the amorphous morphologies, and to calculate the charge transport parameters and hole mobility. Our results show that short- and long-range structural order in condensed phases is strongly influenced by the molecular architecture. Furthermore, charge transport parameters, such as site energies, reorganization energies and coupling integrals, are intimately coupled with the number of redox centers and the way they are connected. The charge transport is differently characterized depending on the degree of morphological disorder, namely reorganization energy-controlled transport in the crystalline phase and site-energy static-disorder controlled transport in the amorphous phase. The computed hole bulk mobilities for both single crystal and amorphous cases are in good agreement with the available experimental literature data.",

This study employed quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction between adamantane and cyclodextrin molecular monomers, as well as the self-assembly mechanism of their modified carboxymethylcellulose in an aqueous solution. The study found that the interaction between adamantane and cyclodextrin molecular monomers is obvious, and the interaction is mainly van der Waals interaction rather than electrostatic interaction. The simulation results for molecular dynamics indicate that modified carboxymethylcellulose polymers follow an assembly mechanism summarized as “node-reinforcement-cement”. In this mechanism, modified molecules interact closely with each other, forming a “node”. The supramolecular polymer then unfolds around the node, creating a “reinforcement bar”. Finally, the addition of water molecules acts as “cement” to form a supramolecular hydrogel. Our research reveals the mechanism of supramolecular self-assembly at the molecular level, which provides a theoretical basis for the next step in the design of new supramolecular polymers.",

            "abstract": "Liquid buildup in gas wells would undoubtedly obstruct the gas production. The use of foaming surfactants to generate foams and remove the loaded liquid is very common. Due to the undesirable conditions (e.g., high condensate cut (ratio of condensate oil volume to total liquid volume) and high salinity, etc.) that often encountered in the wells, different foaming surfactants were often compounded together to unload liquid in gas wells. In this paper, lauramide propyl dimethylamine (C12 Amine), palmitamide propyl dimethylamine (C16 Amine) and cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) were synthesized and compounded with L-aspartic acid (Asp) and N-lauroylsarcosine sodium (LSS) to form foaming supramolecular complexes through optimization (with Waring blender method and liquid unloading tests) to quantify their application potentials in foam-based deliquification treatment for gas wells. The C12 Amine-Asp-LSS-CAPB complex (in an optimized mole ratio of 10:4:14:7) exhibited superior condensate tolerance than the C16 Amine-Asp-LSS-CAPB complex (in an optimized mole ratio of 10:4:14:42). The salinity posed a significant influence on the liquid unloading performance (k) and foaming efficiency (ƞ, defined as the ratio of the foam mass to the initial liquid mass) of the C12 Amine-Asp-LSS-CAPB complex, however, the nitrilotriacetic acid trisodium (NTA) can greatly enhance the properties of the C12 Amine-Asp-LSS-CAPB complex against the salinity (up to 6 × 104 mg/L). The temperature (25 °C −90 °C) favored the performances (as indicated by k and ƞ) of the C12 Amine-Asp-LSS-CAPB complex, which achieved k and ƞ values of 85.0% and 100% at 90 °C, respectively. Meanwhile, the synergy observed in the foaming ability, foam stability and liquid unloading performance tests using the C12 Amine-Asp-LSS-CAPB mixture was also proved by the surface tension analysis and the calculations of the supramolecular interactions (interaction energies and electrostatic interactions).",

It cleaves the two polyproteins at 11 positions to generate mature proteins for virion formation. The cleavage site on these polyproteins is known to be Leu-Gln↓(Ser/Ala/Gly). A range of hexapeptides that follow the known sequence for recognition and cleavage was constructed using RDKit libraries and complexed with the crystal structure of Mpro (PDB ID 6XHM) through extensive molecular docking calculations. A subset of 131 of these complexes underwent 20 ns molecular dynamics simulations. The analyses of the trajectories from molecular dynamics included principal component analysis (PCA), and a method to compare PCA plots from separate trajectories was developed in terms of encoding PCA progression during the simulations. The hexapeptides formed stable complexes as expected, with reproducible molecular docking of the substrates given the extensiveness of the procedure. Only Lys-Leu-Gln*** (KLQ***) sequence complexes were studied for molecular dynamics. In this subset of complexes, the PCA analysis identified four classifications of protein motions across these sequences. KLQ*** complexes illustrated the effect of changes in substrate on the active site, with implications for understanding the substrate recognition of Mpro and informing the development of small molecule inhibitors.",

For CYP2E1, the role of PHE residues in the formation of effective binding orientations for its aromatic substrates remains unclear. In this study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis were performed to reflect the interactions between PHEs in the active site of human CYP2E1 and various aromatic compounds known as its substrates. The results indicated that the orientation of 1-methylpyrene (1-MP) in the active site was highly determined by the presence of PHEs, PHE478 contributing to the binding free energy most significantly. Moreover, by building a random forest model the relationship between each of 19 molecular descriptors of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds (from molecular docking, quantum mechanics, and physicochemical properties) and their human CYP2E1-dependent mutagenicityas established mostly in our lab, was investigated. The presence of PHEs did not appear to significantly modify the electronic or structural feature of each bound ligand (PCB), instead, the flexibility of the conformation of PHEs contributed substantially to the effective binding energy and orientation. It is supposed that PHE residues adjust their own conformation to permit a suitablly shaped cavity for holding the ligand and forming its orientation as favorable for a biochemical reaction. This study has provided some insights into the role of PHEs in guiding the interactive adaptation of the active site of human CYP2E1 for the binding and metabolism of aromatic substrates.",

Simulations show an effect on electronic structure, indicative of electron charge transfer in parallel orientation and small distances and nonelectron energy transfer for different orientations and larger distances. An absorption-emission spectral overlap is observed. The calculations of coupling and energy transfer rates show a distance dependence typical of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in the long range, while in the short and ultra-short range the distance dependence indicates electron transfer in addition to FRET. The Si NCs with the smallest size yield larger couplings than the larger nanocrystals. The PPIX/Si NC coupling was enhanced by adding a plasmon nanoparticle as a bridge in the donor-acceptor system. Results using Au nanoparticles show increased energy transfer rates up to 104 and lower distance dependence.",

Currently, stabilizing strategies are focused on approaches with limited relevance for application under biologically relevant conditions. Initial attempts to stabilise AquaMet by encapsulation within a supramolecular metallocage showed that the nitrate counterions of the cage improve the activity of the catalyst. We show that the chloride ligands of AquaMet can be replaced with nitrates by simple anion-exchange. Catalytic studies into metathesis of a diallyl substrate showed that the presence of nitrate generates higher yields of the ring-closed product compared to AquaMet alone, under aqueous and biological conditions. Kinetic studies support that the nitrate-containing catalyst both initiates faster and performs catalysis at a much faster rate than AquaMet, while the rate of catalyst deactivation was similar. This new strategy of kinetic protection of a transition metal catalyst may have future applications for other catalytic reactions applied in vivo.",

In this study, quantum-sized (CuS)n with cluster-size-dependent distinctiveness of non-shifting, red-shifting, and blue-shifting absorption spectra under photo-excitation were studied experimentally and theoretically; three different stages categorized as molecule, nanocluster and nanoparticle were identified to delineate different mechanisms underlying photo-excitation. Addressing plasmonicity by hole-electron analysis based on time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT), we adapted TD-DFT protocol to measure the distribution, collectiveness and coherence of the excited molecular orbital pairs of (CuS)n. The current calculation can also lend weight to plasmonicity evaluation in other semiconducting alloy and compound nanomaterials. We ascertained the correlation of the optical properties of (CuS)n nanoclusters to enhanced plasmonicity arising from an excitonic-dominated excitation along with growing cluster size n, laying down foundations for precise and controllable applications of (CuS)n nanoclusters. In vivo tumor-ablating assessment of (CuS)n nanocluster preliminarily qualified it as an efficient low-dose photothermal transduction agent under a low NIR-II irradiance. This study provides a comprehensive view on (CuS)n nanoclusters preparation, excitation mechanism and application prospects besides uniqueness in methodology, shedding light on further application investigation and engineering for the light-functioning nanoclusters.",

To obtain comparable geometries from experimental crystal structures, we rely on fast quantum mechanical GFN2-XTB molecule-in-cluster optimizations. Optimized crystal structures are first analysed in terms of molecule-pair interaction energies, by subdividing a cluster generated from asymmetric unit content through space-group symmetry into pairs of molecules. Accurate energies are then obtained by single-point molecular orbital (MO/MO) two layer “ONIOM” energy partitioning, comparing the same molecules in different crystal environments. Clusters approximate the local environment of a crystal structure for ONIOM. The pre-processor program BAERLAUCH (Acta. Cryst. A 2012) was used to set up all cluster computations. Solid-state computations using dispersion-corrected density functional theory provide reference results. ONIOM partitioned energies shed light on the driving force of co-crystal formation, with the energy gain from the complementarity of molecule-pair wavefunctions in such structures being the main driving force. It follows that improving prediction of co-crystal structure formation beyond current approaches, e.g. COSMO-RS excess enthalpies, statistics from structural databases or full crystal structure prediction is possible by finding complementary molecule-pairs through conformational sampling, as ultimately exemplified.",

Like natural photosynthetic systems, the artificial light harvesting complex (LHC) BODIPY pillar[5]arene exhibits Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). However, extensive characterisation of the BODIPY pillar[5]arene LHC to determine its suitability as an artificial LHC has yet to occur. In this paper we experimentally and computationally investigate the photophysical properties of the LHC by comparing the light absorption of the BODIPY LHC to individual BODIPY chromophores. Our results show evidence for quantum coherence, with oscillation frequencies of 100 cm−1 and 600 cm−1, which are attributable to vibronic, or exciton–phonon type coupling. Computational analysis suggests strong couplings of the molecular orbitals of the LHC resulting from the stacking of neighbouring BODIPY chromophore units. Interestingly, we find a 40% reduction in the absorbance of light for the BODIPY LHC compared to the individual chromophores which we attribute to electronic interactions between the conjugated π-systems of the BODIPY chromophores and the pillar[5]arene backbone.",

In this work, for the first time, the direct and indirect photolysis of nadolol (NAD) was investigated under different light sources (simulated solar (SS), UV-LED, and UV radiations) in ultrapure water. Indirect photolysis by H2O2 showed 1.5, 2.1, and 5.6 times higher NAD degradation efficiency than direct photolysis under mentioned irradiations. This effect was particularly pronounced in the presence of UV radiation, in which the degradation efficiency of NAD was the highest (80.2%). Computational analysis based on density functional theory calculations, together with the results of NAD photodegradation efficiency in the presence of radical scavengers (isopropanol and benzoquinone), was used to propose the NAD degradation mechanism. Sixteen degradation intermediates were proposed, along with their NMR chemical shifts. Also, this study analyzed the degree of catalase activity, lipid peroxidation, and hydroxyl radicals neutralization of NAD and its photodegradation mixtures obtained after indirect photolysis. The degree of mineralization and in vitro toxicity of NAD and its degradation intermediates obtained in the presence of UV/H2O2 were assessed.",

Therefore, discussing the hydroxyl/epoxy ratio for GO is relevant to improve the characterization of such material. As the adsorption of Methylene Blue into GO is related to a graphene derivative’s oxidation degree (OD), we combined adsorption experimental information and theoretical data to estimate the hydroxyl/epoxy ratio. The theoretical data were compared to the experimental adsorption of Methylene Blue and Indigo Carmine into GO synthesized in our department. Our results show GO systems with hydroxyl/epoxy ratios equal to 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 are the most representative in which the most coherent model corresponds to OH/EP=0.8 for our GO previously synthesized.",

The study on morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), measurements of mechanical, thermal, and transport properties of the membrane samples was carried out. The main mechanical properties of both membranes do not differ significantly, but the values of ultimate deformation differ palpably as a result of a non-uniform character of the deformation process for the PHI membrane. The thermal analysis based on the curves of thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential thermal (DTA) analyses of the PHI and PHI-Cu(I) membranes revealed peculiarities of the membrane structure. Transport properties were studied in pervaporation (PV) of methanol (MeOH) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) mixtures including an azeotropic point. Intrinsic properties of the penetrant–membrane system were also determined. It was found that the total flux is higher through the PHI membrane, but the PHI-Cu(I) membrane exhibits a higher separation factor. Calculation of the pervaporation separation index (PSI) allowed to conclude that the PHI-Cu(I) membrane exhibits better transport properties as compared with the PHI membrane.",

With this motivation, in this work we have synthesized a novel benzimidazole derived imine ligand, 2-((E)-((1H-benzo[d]-2-yl)methylimino)methyl)-4-fluorophenol (HBMF) and its Co(III) and Cu(II) complexes. The metal complexes (C1–C4) were synthesized in 2:1 (HBMF: metal ion) and 1:1:1 (HBMF: metal ion: 1,10-phen) ratios. Structural elucidations of all the synthesized compounds were performed using FT-IR, UV-Visible, NMR, Mass spectroscopy and elemental analysis techniques. A combination of first principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations was applied to computationally investigate the structural, reactive, and spectroscopic properties of the newly synthesized HBMF ligand and its complexes with copper and cobalt metal ions. Quantum-mechanical calculations in this study were based on the density functional theory (DFT), while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were based on the OPLS4 force field. The DFT calculations were used to obtain the reactive and spectroscopic properties of the ligand and its complexes, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to address the ligand’s reactivity with water. Further, the in vitro anti-proliferative activity of the compounds was tested against the A549, Ehrlich–Lettre ascites carcinoma (EAC), SIHA and NIH3T3 cell lines. The biological results depicted that the compound C4, with molecular formula C27H23Cl2CoFN5O3 exhibited profound anti-proliferative activity against the EAC cell line with a significant IC50 value of 10 µm when compared to its parent ligand and other remaining metal complexes under study. Various assays of hematological parameters (alkaline phosphate, creatinine, urea, RBC and WBC) were performed, and significant results were obtained from the experiments. Furthermore, the effect of C4 on neovascularization was evaluated by stimulating the angiogenesis with rVEGF165, which was compared with non-tumor models. The EAC cells were cultured in vivo and administrated with 50 and 75 mg/kg of two doses and tumor parameters were evaluated.",

Herein, we monitor an ideal chirality transfer process from a statistically random distribution to a diastereomerically pure assembly in real time. The chirality transfer is based on discrete trimeric tubular assemblies of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, achieving the construction of diastereomerically pure trimers of pillar[5]arenes through synergistic effect of ion pairing between a racemic rim-differentiated pillar[5]arene pentaacid bearing five benzoic acids on one rim and five alkyl chains on the other, and an optically resolved pillar[5]arene decaamine bearing ten amines. When the decaamine is mixed with the pentaacid, the decaamine is sandwiched by two pentaacids through ten ion pairs, initially producing a statistically random mixture of a homochiral trimer and two heterochiral trimers. The heterochiral trimers gradually dissociate and reassemble into the homochiral trimers after unit flipping of the pentaacid, leading to chirality transfer from the decaamine and producing diastereomerically pure trimers.",

Their catalytic behaviour is determined by the nature of externally introduced cationic species, i.e., its geometry, chemical composition, and location within the zeolite pores. Superior catalyst designs can be unlocked by understanding the confinement effect and spatial limitations of the zeolite framework and its influence on the geometry and location of such cationic active sites. In this study, we employ the genetic algorithm (GA) global optimization method to investigate extraframework aluminum species and their structural variations in different zeolite matrices. We focus on extraframework aluminum (EFAl) as a model system because it greatly influences the product selectivity and catalytic stability in several zeolite catalyzed processes. Specifically, the GA was used to investigate the configurational possibilities of EFAl within the mordenite (MOR) and ZSM-5 frameworks. The xTB semi-empirical method within the GA was employed for an automated sampling of the EFAl–zeolite space. Furthermore, geometry refinement at the density functional theory (DFT) level of theory allowed us to improve the most stable configurations obtained from the GA and elaborate on the limitations of the xTB method. A subsequent ab initio thermodynamics analysis (aiTA) was chosen to predict the most favourable EFAl structure(s) under the catalytically relevant operando conditions.",

            "abstract": "Foams are often employed as an efficient and cleaner method to remove the liquid accumulated at the bottom of the gas wells and promote the production of natural gas. However, the extreme conditions (e.g., high content of condensate, high salinity, high temperature, etc.) in the wells would retard the performance of the foaming agents. Usually, mixtures of different foaming surfactants were used to achieve high performances under those extreme conditions. In this paper, foams stabilized by surfactant mixtures containing alpha-olefin sulfonate (AOS), synthesized green cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB) and modified quaternary ammonium Gemini surfactant (CAGB) in a proportion of 0.2:0.2:0.2 (wt%/wt%/wt%) were developed to evaluate their industrial application potential in gas well deliquification. The ternary surfactant (CAPB-CAGB-AOS) foam exhibited higher stability than the other dual surfactant foams and singular surfactant foams. Additionally, the foaming efficiency (defined as the ratio of the mass of water converted into foam to the mass of the initial liquid) and liquid unloading efficiency of the CAPB-CAGB-AOS mixture could be improved with the presence of condensate. Salts and methanol had a weak influence on the performance of the CAPB-CAGB-AOS foam. The introduction of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium (EDTA‧2Na) can enhance the performance of the CAPB-CAGB-AOS foam against salts. The temperature (> 60 °C) favored the foaming efficiency and liquid unloading efficiency of the CAPB-CAGB-AOS mixture, which reached up to 100% and 88.5% at 90 °C. These results indicated that the synergy effect of these three surfactants on the stability and liquid unloading efficiency of the foam can be confirmed. Moreover, the synergy effect can also be confirmed by the surface tension test, the foam's microstructure observation and the computational studies on calculated binding energies and electrostatic interactions.",

            "abstract": "Development of C−N coupling methodologies based on Earth-abundant metals is a promising strategy in homogeneous catalysis for sustainable processes. However, such systems suffer from deactivation and low catalytic activity. We here report that encapsulation of Cu(I) within the phenanthroyl-containing calix[8]arene derivative 1,5-(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroyl)-2,3,4,6,7,8-hexamethyl-p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene (C8PhenMe6) significantly enhances C−N coupling activity up to 92 % yield in the reaction of aryl halides and aryl amines, with low catalyst loadings (2.5 % mol). A tailored multiscale computational protocol based on Molecular Dynamics simulations and DFT investigations revealed an oxidative addition/reductive elimination process of the supramolecular catalyst [Cu(C8PhenMe6)I]. The computational investigations uncovered the origins of the enhanced catalytic activity over its molecular analogues: Catalyst deactivation through dimerization is prevented, and product release facilitated. Capturing the dynamic profile of the macrocycle and the impact of non-covalent interactions on reactivity allows for the rationalization of the behavior of the flexible supramolecular catalysts employed.",

Orientational self-sorting refers to the preferential formation of particular isomers within the pool of potential structures. Geometric and computational analyses predict the preferred formation of cages with a cis arrangement at the metal centers. This prediction was corroborated experimentally by synthesizing a [Pd12L24]24+ cage with a bridging 3-(4-(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)pyridine ligand. A crystallographic analysis of this assembly showed exclusive cis coordination of the 3- and the 4-pyridyl donor groups at the Pd2+ ions.",

Here, the molecular recognition mechanism between membrane epitopes and “nearly free silanols” (NFS), a specific subgroup of surface silanols, is identified and proposed as a novel broad explanation for particle toxicity in general. Silica samples having different bulk and surface properties, specifically different amounts of NFS, are tested with a set of membrane systems of decreasing molecular complexity and different charge. The results demonstrate that NFS content is the primary determinant of membrane disruption causing red blood cell lysis and changes in lipid order in zwitterionic, but not in negatively charged liposomes. NFS-rich silica strongly and irreversibly adsorbs zwitterionic self-assembled phospholipid structures. This selective interaction is corroborated by density functional theory and supports the hypothesis that NFS recognize membrane epitopes that exhibit a positive quaternary amino and negative phosphate group. These new findings define a new paradigm for deciphering particle-biomembrane interactions that will support safer design of materials and what types of treatments might interrupt particle-biomembrane interactions.",

In this paper, a green strategy was employed for the immobilization of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) onto reduced graphene with assistance of bio-synthesized nanocellulose, and the resulting graphene-supported-CoPc (CoPc&G) was applied for the catalytic degradation of phenol solution with H2O2 as oxidant. More than 90% of phenol can be removed within 75 min, and the existence of graphene clearly has a positive effect on the catalytic activity. Theoretical calculations were conducted to unveil the catalytic nature of CoPc&G. H2O2 was favorably chemisorbed onto CoPc&G in the form of OOH−, hydroxyl radicals were favorably formed by homolytic cleavage of OO bonds, and ΔG value for the formation of reactive species was decreased with the existence of graphene. Density of states (DOS) analysis shows that graphene could effectively boost the electronic activity, reduce HOMO-LUMO gap, and strengthen the polarizability of the catalyst, thereby lower the free energy gap for the enhanced generation of reactive species. A detailed catalytic degradation route of phenol with CoPc&G + H2O2 system was established based on the combination of theoretical calculations and experimental results.",

            "abstract": "We demonstrate that contemporary computational resources allow for accurate theoretical studies of systems matching recent advances in experimental helicene chemistry. Concerned with first-principles calculations of carbohelicenes, our work surpasses CH[12] as the largest system investigated to date and unravels trends in the electronic structure of the low-lying states of the homologous series. Utilizing a highly efficient implementation of linear response algorithms, we present electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectra of carbohelicenes ranging from CH[5] to CH[30] at the level of Kohn–Sham density-functional theory. Our results for a systematic increase in system size show the emergence of new CD bands that subsequently rise to intensities dominating the spectrum. The spectral band progressions exhibit a periodicity directly linked to the number of overlapping layers of conjugation. While our findings rectify the current understanding of the electronic structure of carbohelicenes, they also serve as a general call for caution regarding the extrapolation of trends from small system ranges.",

            "abstract": "Selective separation of rare earth elements (REEs) from solutions of mixed heavy and light metals by solid adsorbents is an important challenge in the fields of water treatment and metal recovery. The main challenge is water instability of many adsorbents, specifically metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and their low selectivity. Grafting particular organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) on the MIL-101(Cr) MOF can provide both stability and selectivity. When the tributyl phosphate (TBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) hydrogen phosphate (D2EHPA or HDEHP) and bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinicacid (Cyanex®-272) OPCs are grafted and applied to mixed-metal aqueous solutions containing Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Nd3+, Gd3+ and Er3+, MIL-101(Cr) offers high selectivity towards the Nd3+, Gd3+ and Er3+ REEs (with stronger affinity towards Er3+). However, the underlying chemistry is unknown and the factors leading to the selectivity remain poorly understood. To uncover the key molecular-level factors, we performed state-of-the-art computational simulations using a combination of high-level density functional theory (DFT), semi-empirical calculations, and configurational sampling of the metal ion-MOF binding modes in aqueous solutions. Our simulation study reproduced the available experimental results, in addition to determining the contributing intermolecular interactions, uptake modes and the most significant structural features for improving selectivity towards the REEs. Therefore, our most important result is rationalization of the mechanism of REE separation by OPC-grafted MOFs using quantum mechanical and electrostatic principles. The results provide guidelines for synthesis of OPC-grafted MIL-101(Cr) structures with enhanced selectivity and stability. Moreover, an efficient computational framework is proposed to facilitate comprehensive modeling of similar systems.",

            "abstract": "<i>Context.<i/> The isomerism of molecules in the interstellar medium and the mechanisms behind it are essential questions in the chemistry of organic molecules in space. In the particular case of simple formic and thioformic acids, the low temperatures found in molecular clouds indicate that cis-trans isomerization in the gas-phase must be impeded. Reactions taking place on top of interstellar dust grains may explain the isomer interconversion at low temperatures.<i>Aims.<i/> We studied the isomerization processes of formic and thioformic acid that are likely to take place on the surface of interstellar dust grains after being initiated by H abstraction reactions. Similarly, deuterium enrichment of the acids can occur by the same mechanism. Our objective is to shed light on both topics to expand our understanding of the key precursors of organic molecules in space.<i>Methods.<i/> We determined the rate constants for the H abstraction reactions as well as the binding energies for the acids on water ice using ab initio calculations and the instanton method for calculating the rate constants, including quantum tunneling. In addition, we tested the viability of the deuteration of formic acid with tailored experiments and looked for it on the L1544 source.<i>Results.<i/> For formic acid, there is a clear dependence of the H abstraction reactions on the isomer of the reactant, with rate constants at ~50 K that differ by five orders of magnitude. Correspondingly, we did not observe the trans-cis reaction in our experiments. In the case of thioformic acid, a very similar cis-trans reactivity is found for abstraction reactions at the thiol (-SH) group in contrast to a preferential reactivity that is found when abstractions take place at the -CH moiety. We found comparable binding energies for both isomers with average binding energies of around −6200 and −3100 K for formic and thioformic acid, respectively. Our binding energy calculations show that the reactions are precluded for specific orientations, affecting the overall isomerization rate. For H abstractions initiated by deuterium atoms, we found very similar trends, with kinetic isotope effects varying in most cases between 13 and 20.<i>Conclusions.<i/> Our results support the cis-trans interconversion of cis-formic acid on dust grains, suggesting that such an acid should not withstand the conditions found on these objects. On the other hand, the trans isomer is very resilient. Both isomers of thioformic acid are much more reactive. A non-trivial chemistry is behind the apparent excess of its trans isomer that is found in cold molecular clouds and star-forming regions due to a subtle combination of preferential reactivity and binding with the surface. In light of our results, all the deuterated counterparts of thioformic acid are viable molecules to be present on the ISM. In contrast, only the trans isomer of deuterated formic acid is expected, for which we provide upper bounds of detection. Given the mechanisms presented in this paper, other mechanisms must be at play to explain the tiny fraction of cis-formic acid observed in interstellar cold environments, as well as the current trans-DCOOH and trans-HCOOD abundances in hot-corinos.",

            "abstract": "Aqueous direct air capture (DAC) is a key technology toward a carbon negative infrastructure. Developing sorbent molecules with water and oxygen tolerance and high CO2 binding capacity is therefore highly desired. We analyze the CO2 absorption chemistries on amines, alkoxides, and phenoxides with density functional theory calculations, and perform inverse molecular design of the optimal sorbent. The alkoxides and phenoxides are found to be more suitable for aqueous DAC than amines thanks to their water tolerance (lower pKa prevents protonation by water) and capture stoichiometry of 1:1 (2:1 for amines). All three molecular systems are found to generally obey the same linear scaling relationship (LSR) between \np\n𝐾\nCO\n2\n and \np\n𝐾\na\n, since both CO2 and proton are bonded to the nucleophilic (alkoxy or amine) binding site through a majorly \n𝜎\n bonding orbital. Several high-performance alkoxides are proposed from the computational screening. Phenoxides have comparatively poorer correlation between \np\n𝐾\nCO\n2\n and \np\n𝐾\na\n, showing promise for optimization. We apply a genetic algorithm to search the chemical space of substituted phenoxides for the optimal sorbent. Several promising off-LSR candidates are discovered. The most promising one features bulky ortho substituents forcing the CO2 adduct into a perpendicular configuration with respect to the aromatic ring. In this configuration, the phenoxide binds CO2 and a proton using different molecular orbitals, thereby decoupling the \np\n𝐾\nCO\n2\n and \np\n𝐾\na\n. The \np\n𝐾\nCO\n2\n–\np\n𝐾\na\n trend and off-LSR behaviors are then confirmed by experiments, validating the inverse molecular design framework. This work not only extensively studies the chemistry of the aqueous DAC, but also presents a transferrable computational workflow for understanding and optimization of other functional molecules.",

            "abstract": "An efficient protocol for the calculation of 13C pNMR shifts in metal–organic frameworks based on Cu(II) paddlewheel dimers is proposed, which involves simplified structural models, optimised using GFN2-xTB for the high-spin state, and CAM-B3LYP-computed NMR and EPR parameters. Models for hydrated and activated HKUST-1 and hydrated STAM MOFs with one, two and three Cu dimers have been used. The electronic ground states are low-spin and diamagnetic, with pNMR shifts arising from thermal population of intermediate- and high-spin excited states. Treating individual spin configurations in a broken symmetry (BS) approach, and selecting two or more of these to describe individual excited states, the magnetic shieldings of these paramagnetic states are evaluated using the approach by Hrobárik and Kaupp. The total shielding is then evaluated from a Boltzmann distribution between the energy levels of the chosen configurations. The computed pNMR shifts are very sensitive to temperature and, therefore, to the relative energies of the BS spin states. In order to reproduce the temperature dependence of the pNMR shifts seen in experiment, some scaling of the calculated energy gaps is required. A single scaling factor was applied to all levels in any one system, by fitting to experimental results at several temperatures simultaneously. The resulting scaling factor decreases with an increasing number of dimer units in the model (e.g., from ∼1.7 for mono-dimer models to 1.2 for tri-dimer models). The approach of this scaling factor towards unity indicates that models with three dimers are approaching a size where they can be considered as reasonable models for the 13C shifts of infinite MOFs. The observed unusual temperature dependencies in the latter are indicated to arise both from the “normal” temperature dependence of the pNMR shifts of the paramagnetic states and the populations of these states in the thermal equilibrium.",

Significant increases both in inter-sheet distance and critical aggregation concentration were clearly observed after alkylation reaction of asphaltenes, indicating that alkylated treatment could well disaggregate asphaltenes and retard them reaggregating, further confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD results indicate that grafting side-chains with moderate chain lengths, introducing isoalkyl side-chains with larger steric hindrance, or increasing the number of grafted side-chains, is more readily to achieve better disaggregation effect on asphaltene aggregate. Furthermore, a series of non-covalent interactions (NCIs) analyses was performed to elucidate diverse driving forces for disaggregating asphaltenes. Especially via the van der Waals potential analysis, newly developed in recent years, it was found that aside from enhancing exchange-repulsion, the introduction of side-chains brings additional dispersion attraction orthogonal to π-π stacking, thus disrupting the regularity of accumulation of asphaltenes; moreover, through averaged reduced density gradient (aRDG) analysis and adjuvant MD simulations, the role of solvents in affecting the disaggregation behavior was elucidated. This research provides an effective method to disaggregate asphaltenes and contributes to solving the problems caused by asphaltenes aggregation.",

It shows that the N2 selectivity of ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) reached 88.62% with the NH3-N oxidation efficiency of 44.8% in 6 h. The high current efficiency of 84.17% was achieved at 1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl), and the energy consumption was 8.19 kW·h/(kgN). Furthermore, the reaction mechanism has been investigated by in-situ Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) during the reaction. It is verified that the BDD substrate plays a crucial role not only in the improvement of electronic transmission rate and but also the generation of abundant hydroxyl radicals (·OH) which provide proper hydrogen acceptors for the N-H bond activation processes. Theoretical calculations further reveal the doping effect of Cu(OH)2 with NiOOH that constructs the Cu/Ni concerted metal-nitrogen interaction, which stabilizes the relative energies of the intermediates thus promoting the reaction. This work sheds new light on the mechanism of selective electrochemical oxidation of NH3-N and develops an innovative technology of catalytic anode design toward wastewater treatment.",

The aggregates undergo a series of transitions upon increasing the temperature: spherical micelles were initially transformed into large vesicles, but they eventually transformed into smaller vesicles. The vesicular catalytic protocol accommodates an excellent substrate scope with moderate to high yields. The mechanisms of temperature-induced aggregate transition and vesicular catalysis were elucidated by experimental results and DFT calculations. It was revealed that the charge layer of the vesicle grants stronger nucleophilicity to the PhSO2-Cu-D12Ga intermediate.

Two novel synthetic paths to 3,6-disubstituted pyridazines were proposed using readily available acetylene surrogates through flexible C2 unit installation procedures in a common reaction space mode (one-pot) and distributed reaction space mode (two-chamber): (1) an interaction of 1,2,4,5-tetrazine and its acceptor-functionalized derivatives with a CaC2−H2O mixture performed in a two-chamber reactor led to the corresponding pyridazines in quantitative yields; (2) [4+2] cycloaddition of 1,2,4,5-tetrazines to benzyl vinyl ether can be considered a universal synthetic path to a wide range of pyridazines. Replacing water with D2O and vinyl ether with its trideuterated analog in the developed procedures, a range of 4,5-dideuteropyridazines of 95–99% deuteration degree was synthesized for the first time. Quantum chemical modeling allowed to quantify the substituent effect in both synthetic pathways.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the effect of surfactant structure on their ability to modify interfacial properties is of great scientific and industrial interest. In this work, we have synthesized four amide based ionic surfactants under acidic or basic conditions, including CTHA·HCl, CTEA·HCl, CTHA−Na+ and CTEA−Na+. Experiments have proved that the anionic surfactant with polyethylene oxide groups (CTEA−Na+) had the lowest surface tension on the water/n-decane interface. Molecular dynamics simulations have been applied to investigate the structural effect on the adsorption behavior of four different surfactants. The surface tension, interface thickness, interface formation energy, density profiles, order parameters, radial distribution function on the water/n-decane interfaces were calculated and compared. During the equilibrium states, we found that the interface configuration of two cationic surfactants are almost linear while the two anionic surfactants are changed to bending shapes due to the different positions of the hydrophilic head groups. Further DFT study and wavefunction analysis of surfactants have shown that CTEA−Na+ can form stronger vdW interactions with n-decane molecules due to a more neutral electrostatic potential distribution. Meanwhile, the introduction of polyethylene oxide groups has offered more H-bonding sites and resulted in more concentrated H-bonding interactions with water molecules. The difference of weak interactions may contribute to the conformational change and finally affect the interface properties of these ionic surfactants.",

In this paper, three chiral calixarene oligomers (CA[n]P, n=4, 6, 8) were synthesized and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV–vis spectrophotometry, circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), X-ray Powder Diﬀ ;raction (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), 19F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After that, the chiral calixarene oligomers capped silver nanoparticles (CA[n]P-Ag NPs, n=4, 6, 8) were prepared and characterized by FT-IR, UV–vis spectrophotometry, CD and dynamic light scattering (DLS). By using the as prepared CA[n]P-Ag NPs (n=4, 6, 8), highly selective and sensitive chiral recognition to deoxynucleosides was realized and demonstrated by UV–vis and CD. The color of the CAP-Ag NPs changes from yellow to red in the presence of β-L-2′-deoxycytidine (L-dC) or β-L-2′-deoxythymidine (L-dT) at a certain time, but not of their corresponding enantiomer β-D-2′-deoxycytidine (D-dC) or β-L-2′-deoxythymidine (D-dT). Moreover, the chiral recognition ability of CA[n]P-Ag NPs (n=4, 6, 8) toward L-deoxynucleosides was found to be in the order of CA[8]P-Ag NPs＞CA[6]P-Ag NPs＞CA[4]P-Ag NPs. This convenient method shows forceful prospect in developing biochemical sensors and has the potential application in enantiomeric recognition and separation of deoxynucleosides.",

Herein we carried out a high-throughput computational investigation of the thermodynamic stability of different adducts in various functionalized Mn(I) based pincer complexes. We used a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and density functional tight binding (DFTB) calculations to analyze of >700 (M(X)-L(H)) intermediates based on functionalized variants of four pincer type ligand scaffolds derived from PCP, CNC, PNP and SNS ligands. We discovered linear scaling relations between of various species. Strongest correlations were found between species of similar size and chemical nature e. g. correlated best with and worst with . Such scaling relations can be useful for property based screening of catalysts and selection of (co)solvent/substrate/base for optimized reaction conditions. We also investigated the influence of the ligand backbone and the functionalization of donor and backbone sites in the ligand. Our analysis reveals the crucial role of the second coordination sphere functionalization for the reactivity of the complexes with impact in some cases exceeding that of the variation of the functional groups directly attached to the donor atoms.",

In this work the very versatile and impactful porphyrin is employed for examination of the first basic chemical tuning factors that may drive specific aggregation motifs. The 1D motifs are examined as a function of peripheral substituent steric bulk. Subsequently, a 1D-wire versus a 3D-square motif is investigated as a function of the metal–ligand effect. For the first time, an interesting effect of misprediction of semiempirical computations is encountered for a small class of these aggregates and is briefly examined with a conformational search analysis. These findings encourage further in silico work which is greatly required for diminishing the current discovery bottleneck in supramolecular chemistry.",

Such interactions can be considered as “contra-electrostatic” H-bonds, which combine the familiar orbital interaction pattern characteristic for the covalent contribution to the conventional H-bonding with an unusual contra-electrostatic component. While electrostatics is strongly stabilizing component in the conventional C−H⋅⋅⋅X bonds where X is an electronegative main group element, it is destabilizing in the C−H⋅⋅⋅M contacts when M is Au(I), Ag(I), or Cu(I) of NHC−M−Cl systems. Such remarkable C−H⋅⋅⋅M interaction became experimentally accessible within (α-ICyDMe)MCl, NHC-Metal complexes embedded into cyclodextrins. Computational analysis of the model systems suggests that the overall interaction energies are relatively insensitive to moderate variations in the directionality of interaction between a C−H bond and the metal center, indicating stereoelectronic promiscuity of fully filled set of d-orbitals. A combination of experimental and computational data demonstrates that metal encapsulation inside the cyclodextrin cavity forces the C−H bond to point toward the metal, and reveals a still attractive “contra-electrostatic” H-bonding interaction.",

            "abstract": "Recently, chemical interface damping (CID) has been proposed as a new plasmon damping pathway based on interfacial hot-electron transfer from metal to adsorbate molecules. It has been considered essential, owing to its potential implications in efficient photochemical processes and sensing experiments. However, thus far, studies focusing on controlling CID in single gold nanoparticles have been very limited, and in situ reversible tuning has remained a considerable challenge. In these scanning electron microscopy-correlated dark-field spectroscopic measurements and density functional theory calculations, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7])-based host–guest supramolecular interactions were employed to examine and control the CID process using monoamine-functionalized CB[7] (CB[7]-NH2) attached to single gold nanorods (AuNRs). In situ tuning of CID through the CB[7]–oxaliplatin complexation, which can result in the variation of the chemical nature and electronic properties of adsorbates, was presented. In addition, in situ tuning of CID was demonstrated through the competitive release of the oxaliplatin guest from the oxaliplatin@CB[7] complex, which was then replaced by a competitor guest of spermine in sufficient amounts. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance experiments confirmed that the release of the guest is the consequence of adding salt (NaCl). Thus, in situ reversible tuning of CID in single AuNRs was achieved through successive steps of encapsulation and release of the guest on the same AuNR in a flow cell. Finally, single CB[7]-NH2@AuNRs were presented as a recyclable platform for CID investigations after the complete release of guest molecules from their host–guest inclusion complexes. Therefore, this study has paved a new route to achieve in situ reversible tuning of CID in the same AuNR and to investigate the CID process using CB-based host–guest chemistry with various guest molecules in single AuNRs for efficient hot-electron photochemistry and biosensing applications.",

            "abstract": "Organic aerosols (OAs) comprise 20–90 w% of atmospheric aerosols. While they have some positive impacts (e.g. acting as precipitation nuclei), they can pose some negative impacts on human health. The health impacts range from pulmonary inflammation to suppression of defense mechanisms, cancer and death. To understand how OA components can affect human body, this study employed a combination of in silico techniques: molecular docking, quantum chemical analysis of interactions, thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction of OA components with DNA and oxidative stress mechanism, in addition to theoretical evaluation of their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties. As OAs contain many components, this study just focused on benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), the cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene (CPPP) sterane, 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ), hopane (HOP), 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ), and an OA model (fulvic acid; FA), which are all known for their negative health impacts. According to the ADME predictions, the low bioavailability of FA would limit its negative impacts. However, the ADME estimations and docking simulations suggested that BPDE, DMBQ and PQ have significant impact in affecting human health negatively: they can be feasibly distributed throughout human body by human serum albumin, they can likely permeate cell membranes, the blood–brain barrier and the gastrointestinal tract, and they show higher DNA binding efficiencies compared to the other OA components. Based on the quantum chemical calculations, BPDE, DMBQ and PQ can interact with the adenosine nucleobases of DNA, but they cannot directly form DNA adducts because of the nonspontaneous and kinetically infeasible nature of the corresponding reaction routes. Similarly, they cannot directly cause oxidative stress. However, in reference to the experimental evidence offered by earlier studies, their metabolites can result in both oxidative stress and carcinogenicity.",

However, photosensitivity of aza-nucleobases has been reported and understanding their excited state dynamics becomes important. Among all the aza-base, 8-azaguanine (8-AG) shows most complex and unique emission behavior. In this work, excited state dynamics of 8-AG in different solutions are investigated by using time-resolved spectroscopy and the results are discussed with the help of TDDFT calculations. Our data indicates that there are two effective non-radiative decay pathways exist in 9H-8-AG while the major fluorescence emission of 8-AG is originated from 8H-8-AG water complex. Moreover, we show that hydrogen atom at C8 position and hydrogen bonding network around 8-AG can greatly affect its excited state dynamics. These results not only clarify the previous debate of the unusual fluorescence emission of 8-AG in solution but also provide evidence for deep understanding its photophysical and photochemical properties.",

            "abstract": "We report results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations on N-terminus mutants of the copper-bound, amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Eight structures of Aβ were modelled, including seven mutant peptides in addition to the unaltered wild-type (WT). Trajectories analysed for each individual system were all approximately 1.4 μs in length, yielding a total of over 11 μs in total. The impact of these mutations are marked and varied compared to the wild-type peptide, including effects on secondary structure, stability and conformational changes. Each system showed differing levels of stability with some showing consistent, compact conformations whereas others displayed more flexible structures. Contrasts between comparable mutations at similar sites, such as A2T/A2V and D7H/D7N, show the location as well as the type of mutation have effects on protein structure observed in Ramachandran plots. We also report notable changes in peptide structure at residues remote to the site of substitution showing these mutations influence the entirety of Aβ. Salt-bridge profiles show this most clearly: addition or removal of charged residues affecting all salt-bridge interactions present in WT, even those remote from the site of mutation. Effects on secondary structure differ between mutations, most notably a change in incidence of β-strand, which has been linked to enhanced aggregational properties for the peptide. GFN2-xTB semi-empirical calculations show clear differences in binding energies of the copper-centre for each system. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma",

This study also reveals the importance of the element substitution in the potential biological activity of PMIs, being the polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains in the peri position responsible for their antiproliferative activity. Among them, the cationic PMI6 with two PEG chains is the most promising compound since its fluorescence is enhanced in the presence of G-quadruplex structures. Moreover, PMI6 binds to the human telomeric G-quadruplex hTelo with high affinity and displays a high antiproliferative potential towards HeLa (cervical adenocarcinoma), A549 (lung adenocarcinoma) and A2780 (ovarian adenocarcinoma) cells. Its fate can be followed inside cells thanks to its fluorescent properties: the compound is found to accumulate in the mitochondria.",

Here, several disordered structures are revisited from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center `drug subset', the Cambridge Structural Database and own earlier work, where experimental intensities of Bragg diffraction data were available. Using the molecule-in-cluster approach, structures with distinguishable conformations were optimized separately, as extracted from available or generated disorder models of the respective disordered crystal structures. Re-combining these `archetype structures' by restraining positional and constraining displacement parameters for conventional least-squares refinement, based on the optimized geometries, then often achieves a superior fit to the experimental diffraction data compared with relying on experimental information alone. It also simplifies and standardizes disorder refinement. Ten example structures were analysed. It is observed that energy differences between separate disorder conformations are usually within a small energy window of RT (T = crystallization temperature). Further computations classify disorder into static or dynamic, using single experiments performed at one single temperature, and this was achieved for propionamide.",

The Ag+ ions captured by the biosensor acted as recognition sites for the detection of AChE. The CNF-based bionic biosensor (CNF-DNA) could detect Ag+ concentrations as low as 10−6 nM in the presence of interference metal ions (Hg2+, Ba2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+). DNA-template silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) were formed on the surface of CNF-DNA during the detection of Ag+ (CNF-DNA-AgNCs). This new strategy yielded CNF-DNA-AgNCs through the adsorption of Ag+ ions onto the cytosine base of the single-stranded DNA in CNF-DNA without the use of any additional reducer. Meanwhile, the CNF-DNA-AgNCs exhibited excellent sensitivity and selectivity for trace levels (0.053 mU/mL) of AChE in the presence of interference reagents. The novel strategy proposed in this paper may establish a foundation for further research on DNA-template AgNCs for developing biosensors and biomarkers for in vivo and in vitro detection.",

While recent spectacular technological improvements have led to significantly higher resolution three-dimensional reconstructions, the average quality of cryo-EM maps is still at the low-resolution end of the range compared with crystallography. A long-standing challenge for atomic model refinement has been the production of stereochemically meaningful models for this resolution regime. Here, it is demonstrated that including accurate model geometry restraints derived from ab initio quantum-chemical calculations (HF-D3/6-31G) can improve the refinement of an example structure (chain A of PDB entry 3j63). The robustness of the procedure is tested for additional structures with up to 7000 atoms (PDB entry 3a5x and chain C of PDB entry 5fn5) using the less expensive semi-empirical (GFN1-xTB) model. The necessary algorithms enabling real-space quantum refinement have been implemented in the latest version of qr.refine and are described here.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism of aromatic sulfur compounds oxidized on Ti-MWW zeolite with H2O2 was studied by density functional theory. The results show that the adsorption capacity of solvents on Ti-η2-OOH decreases in the order of CH3COCH3> CH3OH > CH3CN > H2O. The energy barriers of thiophene on different active centers are in the order of Ti-η2-OOH-CH3CN < Ti-η2-OOH-CH3COCH3< Ti-η2-OOH-CH3OH < Ti-η2-OOH-H2O < Ti-η2-OOH < Ti-η1-OOH, showing a linear correlation with the Hirshfeld charge of Oα. The interaction energy calculations indicate that the polar solvent not only participates in the reaction but also plays a critical role in timely removing products. Moreover, the oxidative activation energies of four aromatic sulfur compounds follow the order: thiophene > benzothiophene > dibenzothiophene >4, 6-dimethyldibenzothiophene, confirming that Ti-MWW could provide sufficient space for the aromatic sulfur compounds with relatively large molecular size and has an excellent oxidation desulfurization performance. Our results address the controversy over the oxidation desulfurization reactivity of aromatic sulfur compounds by Ti-MWW in experimental studies and provide insights to further studies.",

At low bias (+0.2 V) a production of 10.0, 6.0 and 5.4 mg L−1 of methanol was obtained for TiO2NT@PDA-NsCu2O, TiO2NT@PDA-NoCu2O, and TiO2NT@PDA-NcCu2O electrodes, with faradaic efficiencies of 27, 39, and 66%, respectively. The conversion to methanol was 357% higher with NcCu2O, compared to the TiO2NT@PDA electrode. The results indicated that both the optical properties and the photocatalytic performance of nanostructures were facet-dependent. The superior catalytic activity of NcCu2O was attributed to the higher concentration of oxygen vacancies on {100} facets, which promotes the activation of CO2 with an energy of −1.2 kcal mol−1. With a lower concentration of oxygen vacancies, CO2 molecule is only physisorbed on {111} facets with an energy of −8.8 kcal mol−1.",

            "abstract": "This work reports an uncommon modulation of columnar segregation of metal–organic triphenylene liquid crystals by blending two structurally dissimilar metallomesogens that can self-associate through complementary electron donor–acceptor interactions. The constituent molecules are cis-[PtCl2(CNR)2] (CNR = 2-(6-(4-isocyanophenoxy)hexyloxy)-3,6,7,10,11-pentakisdodecyloxytriphenylene) that displays an organic/inorganic segregated columnar mesophase and [PtCl2(Bipy)] (Bipy = didodecyl 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylate) that shows a lamellar mesomorphism. The phase diagram of this system was constructed using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray scattering data. The phase diagram corresponds to a typical binary system with an intermediate compound (in this case a supramolecular aggregate) of stoichiometry [PtCl2(CNR)2]/2[PtCl2(Bipy)], which is maintained in solution. This species shows an unusual columnar mesophase formed by the stacking of alternating organic/inorganic fragments. Quantum chemical calculations show that the columnar structure is mainly supported by complementary π electron donor–acceptor interactions between each triphenylene group of the isocyanide complex and a platinum-bipyridine molecule. This induces the elimination of the organic/inorganic columnar segregation of the isocyano parent component and constitutes an unconventional example of modulation of organic/inorganic segregation in columnar mesophases by the intercalation of metal complexes into hexaalkoxytriphenylene stacks.",

Phys. 2018, 148, 094111] based on the frozen virtual natural orbital and natural auxiliary function approaches is extended to core excitations. The efficiency of the approximation is presented for the second-order algebraic-diagrammatic construction [ADC(2)] method invoking the core–valence separation (CVS) and density fitting approaches. The errors introduced by the present scheme are comprehensively analyzed for more than 200 excitation energies and 80 oscillator strengths, including C, N, and O K-edge excitations, as well as 1s → π* and Rydberg transitions. Our results show that significant savings can be gained in computational requirements at the expense of a moderate error. That is, the mean absolute error for the excitation energies, being lower than 0.20 eV, is an order of magnitude smaller than the intrinsic error of CVS-ADC(2), while the mean relative error for the oscillator strengths is between 0.06 and 0.08, which is still acceptable. As significant differences for different types of excitations cannot be observed, the robustness of the approximation is also demonstrated. The improvements in the computational requirements are measured for extended molecules. In this case, an overall 7-fold speedup is obtained in the wall-clock times, while dramatic reductions in the memory requirements are also achieved. In addition, it is also proved that the new approach enables us to perform CVS-ADC(2) calculations within reasonable runtime for systems of 100 atoms using reliable basis sets.",

We show that this yields a low-scaling and accurate method across a diverse benchmark test set that is capable of treating moderate levels of strong correlation effects, and we detail an efficient implementation for applications involving up to ∼1000 orbitals on parallel resources. We then use this method to characterize the spectral properties of the antimalarial drug molecule artemisinin, resolving discrepancies in previous works concerning the active sites of the lowest-energy fundamental excitations of the system.",

            "abstract": "Functional materials composed of spontaneously self-assembled electron donor and acceptor entities capable of generating long-lived charge-separated states upon photoillumination are in great demand as they are key in building the next generation of light energy harvesting devices. However, creating such well-defined architectures is challenging due to the intricate molecular design, multistep synthesis, and issues associated in demonstrating long-lived electron transfer. In this study, we have accomplished these tasks and report the synthesis of a new fullerene–bis-Zn-porphyrin e-bisadduct by tether-directed functionalization of C60 via a multistep synthetic protocol. Supramolecular oligomers were subsequently formed involving the two porphyrin-bearing arms embracing a fullerene cage of the vicinal molecule as confirmed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry and variable temperature NMR. In addition, the initially formed worm-like oligomers are shown to evolve to generate donut-like aggregates by AFM monitoring that was also supported by theoretical calculations. The final supramolecular donuts revealed an inner cavity size estimated as 23 nm, close to that observed in photosynthetic antenna systems. Upon systematic spectral, computational, and electrochemical studies, an energy level diagram was established to visualize the thermodynamic feasibility of electron transfer in these donor–acceptor constructs. Subsequently, transient pump–probe spectral studies covering the wide femtosecond-to-millisecond time scale were performed to confirm the formation of long-lived charge-separated states. The lifetime of the final charge-separated state was about 40 μs, thus highlighting the significance of the current approach of building giant self-organized donor–acceptor assemblies for light energy harvesting applications.",

            "abstract": "Helical supramolecular architectures play important structural and functional roles in biological systems. Although their occurrence is widely perceived to correlate to fundamental chiral units including l-amino acids and d-sugars, the detailed relationship between molecular and supramolecular handedness is still unclear. At the same time, although achiral units are practically always in close proximity to chiral ones by covalent linkage along a polymeric chain, their effect on supramolecular handedness has received relatively less attention. Here, we designed a set of short amphiphilic peptides, in which an achiral glycine residue was incorporated at the interface between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments. We observed that glycine incorporation caused dramatic variations in suprastructural handedness in self-assembled peptide nanofibrils, and the effect of the hydrophilic charged residue at the C-terminus on supramolecular handedness was demolished, leading to chiral truncation. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry calculations revealed that the unanticipated role of the glycine residue in regulating supramolecular handedness originated from its effect on the conformational preference of single β-strands. Importantly, reduced density gradient analyses on single β-strands indicated that, due to the lack of a side chain in glycine, intricate noncovalent interactions were produced among the neighboring amino acid side chains of the incorporated glycine and its local backbone, resulting in diverse β-strand conformations.",

In the present study we extend this approach to the subsystem-based description of total systems by means of GW and the Bethe–Salpeter equation (BSE). For this, we derive the working equations starting from a subsystem-based partitioning of the screened-Coulomb interaction for an arbitrary number of subsystems. Making use of certain approximations, we develop a parameter-free approach in which environmental screening contributions are effectively included for each subsystem. We demonstrate the applicability of these approximations by comparing quasi-particle energies and excitation energies from subsystem-based GW/BSE calculations to the supermolecular reference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the computational efficiency and the usefulness of this method for the description of photoinduced processes in complex chemical environments.",

Metal-coordination-driven directional self-assembly into supramolecular metallacycles provides a powerful strategy to position several motor units in larger structures with well-defined geometries. Herein, we present a pyridyl-modified molecular motor ligand (MPY) which upon coordination with geometrically distinct di-Pt(II) acceptors assembles into discrete metallacycles of different sizes and shapes. This coordination leads to a red-shift of the absorption bands of molecular motors, making these motorized metallacycles responsive to visible light. Photochemical and thermal isomerization experiments demonstrated that the light-driven rotation of the motors in the metallacycles is similar to that in free MPY in solution. CD studies show that the helicity inversions associated with each isomerization step in the rotary cycle are preserved. To explore collective motion, the trimeric motor-containing metallacycle was aggregated with heparin through multiple electrostatic interactions, to construct a multi-component hierarchical system. SEM, TEM, and DLS measurements revealed that the photo- and thermal-responsive molecular motor units enabled selective manipulation of the secondary supramolecular aggregation process without dissociating the primary metallacycle structures. These visible-light-responsive metallacycles, with intrinsic multiple rotary motors, offer prospects for cooperative operations, dynamic hierarchical self-assembled systems, and adaptive materials.",

            "abstract": "Engineering of supramolecular topologies offers potential opportunities for tailoring their properties to various function and applications. However, the synthesis of interlocked or intertwined compounds, catenanes, links or knots, is a challenge. Previously, we used coordination-driven self-assembly and noncovalent interactions (NCIs) between metal-based acceptors and multipyridyl donors to create supramolecular topologies with increasing complexity. Self-assembling components of fixed length and geometry have been utilized for the production of topologies such as Borromean rings, Solomon links, Hopf’s link, “rectangle in rectangle”, and an 818 molecular knot. However, recent synthesis of a linear [3]catenane by us witnessed the importance of flexible ligands along with coordination-driven self-assembly and NCIs in self-assembling units. This flexibility provides distinctive angularity for the recognition of various NCIs and thus offers tremendous possibilities for realizing complex supramolecular topologies. This study proposed a selective and quantitative synthesis, and also the first X-ray characterization of a closed three-link chain (a prime link of [3]catenane with 6 crossings) via two component coordination-driven self-assembly. The experiments based upon concentration, guest template, and solvent effects were systematically presented. Furthermore, the experimental finding was supported by density functional theory calculations, which highlighted the necessity of the multiple NCIs along with appropriate geometry of the [2 + 2] rings.",

However, very few molecular design strategies have been developed on such metallacycles. Herein, we report a new series of stable and well-defined NIR-absorbing metallacycles (M1–M3) through the Pt–acetylide coordination with highly efficient photoconversion performance for cancer phototherapy. The metallacycles showed high stability and strong NIR absorption, and the absorption peaks were red shifted approximately 30 nm in comparison with their corresponding precursors. The introduction of Pt into metallacycles promotes significant photoconversions, including the singlet-to-triplet and nonradiative transitions. Moreover, the fabricated M3 nanoparticles (M3-NPs) showed favorable photoconversions into both thermal effect and singlet oxygen generation upon NIR irradiation, achieving tumor ablation. This novel design of Pt-acetylide metallacycles possesses not only complex topological architectures but also a valuable paradigm for precise cancer phototherapy, which is important for grafting stimuli-responsive functional groups into metallacycles for the development of high-performance biomedical supramolecular materials.",

Compared with polymeric adhesive materials, it remains challenging for supramolecualr adhesive materials to realize tough adhesion on wet surfaces or even under water. In this study, a new supramolecular adhesive consisting of low-molecular-weight monomers was successfully designed and prepared. Strong and long-term adhesion performance was realized on various surfaces, with a maximum adhesion strength of 4.174 MPa. This supramolecular adhesive exhibits tough and stable adhesion properties in high-moisture and underwater environments (including seawater). Long-term underwater adhesion tests display the potential application of low-molecular-weight adhesive as a marine adhesive.",

The study aims to simulate the docking of garcinisidone-A (Gar-A), molecular dynamics, and predict the ADME by predicting the binding of the HER2 protein in breast cancer cells and developing new drug candidate options for cancer treatment, often starting with computational analysis.\nMethods: The research method involves computational utilization of pkCSM applications, Gar-A docking simulation with the HER2 protein using Gnina software version 1.0.2, and molecular dynamics conducted with GROMACS 2022.2 and CHARMMGUI applications.\nResults: Gar-A has a molecular weight of less than 500, a Log P value of greater than 5, a limited amount of water solubility, a low level of skin permeability, good intestinal permeability, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pose score on the HER2 protein of 0.6178. It also does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, and total clearance values indicate rapid elimination via other excretory routes or enzyme metabolism. Gar-A is thought to have interactions with HER2. There are hydrogen bond interactions with amino acids Lys753 and Asp863, carbon-hydrogen bonds with amino acids Leu785, Ser783, Thr862, and alkyl bonds with amino acids Leu726, Leu852, and Ile767. The stability of the Gar-A-substrate interaction could have been more evident during 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation.\nConclusion: The physicochemical properties of Gar-A align with Lipinski's rule for drug candidates. ADME predictions indicate good intestinal permeability for Gar-A; however, it suggests it cannot penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The docking results reveal that Gar-A has a value close to one which indicates similar action to its natural ligand and molecular dynamics simulations that Gar-A is less stable. The results illustrate that Gar-A has the potential as a breast anticancer.",

Inspired by the recent realization of two dimensional nanomaterials as DNA detectors as well as sensors, the interactions of pristine and B/N/O/P-doped coronenes with adenine nucleobase have been studied on the basis of Density Functional Theory. Optimal configurations, the corresponding adsorption energies, charge transfer and electrical properties have been calculated for each complex. The adsorption strength and charge transfer in doped coronene have been found larger than that in the pristine coronene. AIM-RDG study suggests that non-covalent interactions existing in the associated interactive region are responsible for the stability of the complexes. The change in electrical conductivity of coronenes after the adsorption indicates its sensitivity towards DNA bases. The predicted energy gap and the prolonged recovery time for adenine-coronene configurations imply that pristine/doped coronene has potential applications in DNA detection.",

The main goal was to assess the self-cleaning characteristics of the surfaces obtained. This study employs scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to analyze the morphology of TiO2-modified acrylic surfaces, revealing spherical particles. Raman spectroscopy elucidates signatures characterizing TiO2 incorporation within the acrylic matrix, providing comprehensive insights into structural and compositional changes for advanced surface engineering. Alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy was used to assess selected charge transport properties of produced self-cleaning surfaces, allowing us to gain valuable insights into the material’s conductivity and its potential impact on photocatalytic performance. The self-cleaning properties of these tiles were tested against three frequently used textile dyes, which are considered to pose a serious environmental threat. Subsequently, improving self-cleaning properties was achieved by plasma treatment, utilizing a continuous plasma arc. The plasma treatment led to enhanced charge separation and surface reactivity, crucial factors in the self-cleaning mechanism. To deepen our comprehension of the reactive properties of dye molecules and their degradation dynamics, we employed a combination of density functional tight binding (DFTB) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This investigation lays the foundation for advancing self-cleaning materials with extensive applications, from architectural coatings to environmental remediation technologies.",

This work reports both the experimental and computational investigation of wastewater perchlorate adsorption on surfactant-modified activated carbon cloth (ACC) in order to design an efficient water treatment system. Three different types of cationic surfactants including tetramethylammonium (TMA), benzyltrimethylammonium (BTMA), and dodecyltrimethylammonium (DDTMA) were employed in this study, and the ClO4- adsorption capacity of various adsorbents was determined in batch experiments for 24 hours. Among all, DDTMA-ACC exhibits the highest ClO4- adsorption capacity (4.5 times that of pristine ACC), the highest monolayer coverage capacity () value (0.59 mmol/g), an equilibrium adsorption constant () value (35.90 L/mmol), and the lowest value (-26.0 KJ/mol), revealing that ClO4- has a stronger affinity for ACC functionalized by DDTMA than ACC functionalized by other surfactants. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also conducted to illustrate the interactions among ClO4-, surfactants, and a model graphite surface underwater environment. The relative number density profiles and cumulative number studies demonstrate that TMA/BTMA tends to form single-layered packing near the graphite surface, while DDTMA prefers to pack in a multilayered fashion. The dense packing behavior of DDTMA on the graphite surface can enhance the ClO4- adsorption, showing good agreement with experimental results.",

Developing high-dimensional RAPs with porous structures and crosslinkers can further improve their stability and redox capability by reducing the solubility and enhancing reaction kinetics. This work reports two three-dimensional (3D) RAPs as stable organic cathodes in Na-ion batteries (NIBs) and K-ion batteries (KIBs). Carbonyl functional groups are incorporated into the repeating units of the RAPs by the polycondensation of Tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)methane and two different dianhydrides. The RAPs with interconnected 3D extended conjugation structures undergo multi-electron redox reactions and exhibit high performance in both NIBs and KIBs in terms of long cycle life (up to 8000 cycles) and fast charging capability (up to 2 A g−1). The results demonstrate that developing 3D RAPs is an effective strategy to achieve high-performance, affordable, and sustainable NIBs and KIBs.",

            "abstract": "The functionalization of π-conjugated scaffolds with sterically demanding substituents is a widely used tactic to suppress cofacial (H-type) stacking interactions, which may even inhibit self-assembly. Contrary to expectations, we demonstrate herein that increasing steric effects can result in an enhanced thermodynamic stability of H-type supramolecular polymers. In our approach, we have investigated two boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes with bulky phenyl (2) and mesityl (3) meso-substituents and compared their self-assembly in nonpolar media with that of a parent meso-methyl BODIPY 1 lacking bulky groups. While the enhanced steric demand induces pathway complexity, the superior thermodynamic stability of the H-type pathways can be rationalized in terms of additional enthalpic gain arising from intermolecular C−H⋅⋅⋅F−B interactions of the orthogonally arranged aromatic substituents, which overrule their inherent steric demand. Our findings underline the importance of balancing competing non-covalent interactions in self-assembly.",

The pure macrocycle self-assembles in bulk into one-dimensional liquid-crystalline columnar phases. In contrast, its self-assembly mode drastically changes in CHCl3 or tetrachloroethane, leading to 2D hydrogen-bonded networks. Theoretical calculations, complemented by previously reported crystalline structures, indicate that the 2D assembly is formed by a brick-like hydrogen bonding pattern between bis-urea macrocycles. This assembly is promoted by the swelling of the trisdodecyloxyphenyl groups upon solvation, which frustrates, due to steric effects, the formation of the thermodynamically more stable columnar macrocycle stacks. This work proposes a new design strategy to access 2D supramolecular polymers by means of a single non-covalent interaction motif, which is of great interest for materials development.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how secondary aerosols form in the atmosphere is one of the main uncertainties for a better understanding of global warming. Secondary aerosols form from gas-phase molecules that combine to create prenucleation complexes, which can then grow to form aerosols. The study of the formation of prenucleation complexes is difficult from both an experimental and theoretical point of view. Sulfuric acid has been linked to the formation of aerosols, yet the details of interactions are not understood. We have completed an exhaustive study of the formation of prenucleation complexes of three strong acids: sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid, combined with ammonia and dimethylamine bases, and three water molecules. By combining an evolutionary algorithm search routine with density functional geometry optimizations and single-point electronic energy calculations with complete basis set (CBS) extrapolations, we have completed an exhaustive search of the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS//ωB97X-D/6-31++G** Gibbs free energy surface for this system. We have used previous work where the weaker formic acid replaces either nitric acid or hydrochloric acid to explore the details of how three acids combine with two bases and a few water molecules to make prenucleation clusters. As clusters grow, stabilizing effects of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and formic acid change in unique ways. This research adds to the body of work that illustrates that, depending on the system being studied, the acid/base strength of the monomers, the charge distribution within the clusters, and the detailed hydrogen bond topology have a subtle interplay that determines which cluster is most stable.",

In such containers the local environment and pre-organization of catalysts and substrates leads to control of the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Herein we report a supramolecular strategy to encapsulate single catalysts in a urea-functionalized Fe4L6 cage, which can co-encapsulate a functionalized urea substrate through hydrogen bonding. Distinguished selectivity is obtained, imposed by the cage as site isolation only allows catalysis through π activation of the substrate and as a result the selectivity is independent of catalyst concentration. The encapsulated catalyst is more active than the free analogue, an effect that can be ascribed to transitionstate stabilization rather than substrate pre-organization, as revealed by the MM kinetic data. The simple strategy reported here is expected to be of general use in many reactions, for which the catalyst can be functionalized with a sulfonate group required for encapsulation.",

Taking advantage of the ability of metallo–organic Pd(II)-subphthalocyanine (SubPc) capsules to form stable host:guest complexes with C60, we have prepared a water-soluble cage that provides a hydrophobic environment for conducting cycloadditions over encapsulated C60, namely, Diels–Alder reactions with anthracene. Indeed, the presence of catalytic amounts of SubPc cage dissolved in water promotes co-encapsulation of insoluble C60 and anthracene substrates, allowing the reaction to occur inside the cavity under mild conditions. The lower stability of the host:guest complex with the resulting C60 cycloadduct facilitates its displacement by pristine C60, which grants catalytic turnover. Moreover, bis-addition compounds are regioselectively formed inside the cage when using excess anthracene.",

In the attempt to translate this tunability to the identification of potential neurodrugs, herein, four Pt(II) complexes were investigated in their ability to modulate the self-aggregation processes of two amyloidogenic models: Sup35p7–13 and NPM1264–277 peptides. In particular, phenanthriplatin revealed the most efficient agent in the modulation of amyloid aggregation: through several biophysical assays, as Thioflavin T (ThT), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, this complex revealed able to markedly suppress aggregation and to disassemble small soluble aggregates. This effect was due to a direct coordination of phenanthriplatin to the amyloid, with the loss of several ligands and different stoichiometries, by the formation of π–π and π–cation interactions as indicated from molecular dynamic simulations. Presented data support a growing and recent approach concerning the repurposing of metallodrugs as potential novel neurotherapeutics.",

Unlike in water or deuterium oxide, addition of a selection of alkali and alkali-earth cations with van der Waals radii between 1.0 and 1.4 Å (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+ and Eu3+) to the CB[7]/guest complexes triggers their cation-mediated trimerization, a process that is very slow on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) time scale. Smaller (Li+, Mg2+) or larger cations (Rb+, Cs+ or NH4+) are inert. The trimers display extensive CH–O interactions between the equatorial and pseudo-equatorial hydrogens of CB[7] and the carbonyl rim of the neighboring CB[7] unit in the trimer, and a deeply nested cation between the three interacting carbonylated CB[7] rims; a counteranion is likely perched in the shallow cavity formed by the three outer walls of CB[7] in the trimer. Remarkably, a guest must occupy the cavity of CB[7] for trimerization to take place. Using a combination of semi-empirical and density functional theory techniques in conjunction with continuum solvation models, we showed that trimerization is favored in DMSO, and not in water, because the penalty for the partial desolvation of three of the six CB[7] portals upon aggregation into a trimer is less unfavorable in DMSO compared to water.",

Moreover, their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated by comparing them to the reference substances BDP, 10a, 10b, and C60. All C60-BODIPY-TAA derivatives absorb visible light strongly in a range between 535 and 563 nm, and photoexcitation of the BODIPY unit causes photo-induced electron transfer, producing the corresponding charge-separated species, which was confirmed by solvatochromic effects on fluorescence measurements. The direction of charge transfer was also revealed by their redox potentials. A better electron affinity was observed for the ISO series when compared with PIR and BDPF. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the pyrrolidine derivatives are more stable than their isoxazoline analogs and the insertion of alkoxy units in the triads triggers a better thermal endurance in the studied compounds.",

            "abstract": "Biomass-derived carbons are promising anodes in potassium-ion hybrid capacitors owing to their tunable structure and competitive cost-effectiveness. The intercalation of K+ ions into carbonaceous anode is a sluggish reaction due to the turbostratic structure and large radius of K+ ions, resulting in the inability to exploit its high capacity and high-rate capability. Nitrogen-doping strategy could enhance the K-ion storage performance by surface capacitive adsorption mechanism. Nevertheless, conventional nitrogen-doping strategies could only endow biomass-derived carbons with low nitrogen-doping levels (<10 at.%), owing to the general agglomeration issue of biomass molecules and the easy release of nitrogen dopant during carbonization. Herein, we proposed a supermolecule-regulated strategy, which enables the breakage of the agglomeration of lignin molecule and disperses lignin in Lewis alkali-acid coupled supermolecule through inter-molecule interactions between lignin and the supermolecule. The co-decomposition of supermolecule/lignin composite precursor could form a covalent-bonded graphitic carbon nitride/carbon intermediate, ensuring the high nitrogen doping level (17.0 at.%) in lignin-derived carbon. The obtained carbon anode delivered high reversible capacities and high-rate capability. All-carbon potassium-ion hybrid capacitors constructed by this carbon as both anode and cathode exhibited a high energy density and power density. This work proposes a general method for constructing highly nitrogen-doped carbon anodes with superior performances.",

Herein, tannic acid-functionalized virus-like Fe3O4 (vFe3O4-TA) was established for bacterial enrichment. We investigated the ability of vFe3O4-TA to capture Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, S. flex and S. typhi) and Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, MRSA and LM), respectively. Compared to the capture efficiency of <15 % for Gram-negative bacteria, vFe3O4-TA showed excellent selectivity and efficiency in isolating Gram-positive bacteria with >87 % removal efficiency. GFN-xTB semiempirical quantum chemical calculations revealed that the selective recognition originates from the high affinity between TA and peptidoglycan. Without impacting ingredients, the TA-mediated trapper also shows excellent ability to distinguish Gram-positive bacteria in juice samples. These results are expected to reveal the interaction of TA with bacteria, and inaugurate a potential natural safe tool for food safety control, medical treatment and environmental remediation.",

            "abstract": "The chelating ability of quinoxaline cores and the redox activity of organosulfide bridges in layered covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer dual active sites for reversible lithium (Li)-storage. The designed COFs combining these properties feature disulfide and polysulfide-bridged networks showcasing an intriguing Li-storage mechanism, which can be considered as a lithium–organosulfide (Li–OrS) battery. The experimental–computational elucidation of three quinoxaline COFs containing systematically enhanced sulfur atoms in sulfide bridging demonstrates fast kinetics during Li interactions with the quinoxaline core. Meanwhile, bilateral covalent bonding of sulfide bridges to the quinoxaline core enables a redox-mediated reversible cleavage of the sulfursulfur bond and the formation of covalently anchored lithium–sulfide chains or clusters during Li-interactions, accompanied by a marked reduction of Li–polysulfide (Li–PS) dissolution into the electrolyte, a frequent drawback of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. The electrochemical behavior of model compounds mimicking the sulfide linkages of the COFs and operando Raman studies on the framework structure unravels the reversibility of the profound Li-ion–organosulfide interactions. Thus, integrating redox-active organic-framework materials with covalently anchored sulfides enables a stable Li–OrS battery mechanism which shows benefits over a typical Li–S battery.",

Refining a well-established potential of mean force (PMF) approach to selections of constraints based on root-mean-square fluctuations results in an excellent agreement between the calculated and observed absolute free binding energy of TMPyP4. The binding affinity of IPLR-G4 toward TEGPy is predicted to be higher than that toward TMPyP4 by 2.5 kcal/mol, which can be traced back to stabilization provided by the polyether side chains of TMPyP4 that can nestle into the grooves of the quadruplex and form hydrogen bonds through the ether oxygen atoms. Because our refined methodology can be applied to large ligands with high flexibility, the present research opens an avenue for further ligand design in this important area.",

Because of the rectangular, as opposed to square, geometry of the ligand panels, and the possibility of either Δ or Λ handedness of each metal center at the eight corners of the pseudo-cube, many different cage diastereomers are possible. Each of the six tetra-aniline subcomponents investigated in this work assembled with zinc(II) and 2-formylpyridine in acetonitrile into a single Zn8L6 pseudo-cube diastereomer, however. Each product corresponded to one of four diastereomeric configurations, with T, Th, S6 or D3 symmetry. The preferred diastereomer for a given tetra-aniline subcomponent was shown to be dependent on its aspect ratio and conformational flexibility. Analysis of computationally modeled individual faces or whole pseudo-cubes provided insight as to why the observed diastereomers were favored.",

            "abstract": "Cyclopropanation reactions between C60 and different malonates decorated with monosaccharides and steroids using the Bingel-Hirsch methodology have allowed the obtention of a new family of hybrid compounds in good yields. A complete set of instrumental techniques has allowed us to fully characterize the hybrid derivatives and to determine the chemical structure of monocycloadducts. Besides, the proposed structures were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, which evidenced the exclusive reductive pattern of fullerene Bingel-type monoadducts. Theoretical calculations at the DFT-D3(BJ)/PBE 6-311G(d,p) level of the synthesized conjugates predict the most stable conformation and determine the factors that control the hybrid molecules′ geometry. Some parameters such as polarity, lipophilicity, polar surface area, hydrophilicity index, and solvent-accessible surface area were also estimated, predicting its potential permeability and capability as cell membrane penetrators. Additionally, a molecular docking simulation has been carried out using the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) as the receptor, thus paving the way to study the potential application of these hybrids in biomedicine.",

We present here the magnetically based superaromatic stabilization energy (m-SSE) as a local aromaticity index and validate it against its topologically based counterpart t-SSE. By comparing to DFT-computed aromaticity indices of triplet state excited polybenzenoid hydrocarbons, we find that semi-quantitative agreement can be reached by using the variable β method to account for bond-length alternation. The m-SSE can further be separated into orbital and circuit contributions to gain insight into the basis of the aromatic properties of individual rings. Fully automated algorithms for calculating both m-SSE and t-SSE are now available in the COULSON package. We envision that these graph theoretical aromaticity indices will be of great use to the community to analyze the local aromaticity of excited states.",

            "abstract": "In this work, the ab initio fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method was applied to calculate and analyze the binding energy of two biscarbene-Au(I) derivatives, [Au(9-methylcaffein-8-ylidene)2]+ and [Au(1,3-dimethylbenzimidazol-2-ylidene)2]+, to the DNA G-Quadruplex structure. The FMO2 binding energy considers the ligand-receptor complex as well as the isolated forms of energy-minimum state of ligand and receptor, providing a better description of ligand-receptor affinity compared with simple pair interaction energies (PIE). Our results highlight important features of the binding process of biscarbene-Au(I) derivatives to DNA G-Quadruplex, indicating that the total deformation-polarization energy and desolvation penalty of the ligands are the main terms destabilizing the binding. The pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) between ligand and nucleobases suggest that the main interaction terms are electrostatic and charge-transfer energies supporting the hypothesis that Au(I) ion can be involved in π-cation interactions further stabilizing the ligand-receptor complex. Moreover, the presence of polar groups on the carbene ring, as C = O, can improve the charge-transfer interaction with K+ ion. These findings can be employed to design new powerful biscarbene-Au(I) DNA-G quadruplex binders as promising anticancer drugs. The procedure described in this work can be applied to investigate any ligand-receptor system and is particularly useful when the binding process is strongly characterized by polarization, charge-transfer and dispersion interactions, properly evaluated by ab initio methods.",

These compounds have been observed to aggregate in acetonitrile/water mixtures and the results have been compared with two other gold(I) compounds previously synthesized by our group that contain a water soluble phosphane instead of the pyridyl ligand. We observed that the coumarin derivative is much more stable while the aniline analogue decomposes in the presence of small amounts of water. The aggregation of this coumarin gold(I) compound has been deeply studied by DLS, SAXS, optical microscopy and electron microscopy (SEM and cryo-TEM). The calculation of the crystal packing parameter confirms a vesicle-type assembly. In order to obtain more detailed information about the composition of vesicles, the number of molecules involved in the self-assembly process has been determined (Nagg = 82). DFT calculations support these data, determining a size of around 90 Å for the vesicles, which may form coacervates to yield the larger structures observed under a microscope.",

SQs 1–3, with different steric bulk, self-assemble in solution into particles (AggI) upon cooling to 298 K, and SQs 1 and 2, with only one dendronic group, show a reversible transformation into fibers (AggII) by further decreasing the temperature to 288 K. Nano-DSC and UV/Vis studies on SQ 1 reveal a concentration-dependent transition temperature and ΔH for the AggI-to-AggII conversion, while the kinetic studies on SQ 2 indicate the on-pathway nature of the polymorph transition. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal that these transitions are triggered by the molecular reorganization of the SQ units changing from slipped to head-to-tail hydrogen bonding patterns. This work unveils the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of reversible polymorph transitions that are of interest to develop stimuli-responsive systems.",

            "abstract": "How secondary aerosols form is critical as aerosols' impact on Earth's climate is one of the main sources of uncertainty for understanding global warming. The beginning stages for formation of prenucleation complexes, that lead to larger aerosols, are difficult to decipher experimentally. We present a computational chemistry study of the interactions between three different acid molecules and two different bases. By combining a comprehensive search routine covering many thousands of configurations at the semiempirical level with high level quantum chemical calculations of approximately 1000 clusters for every possible combination of clusters containing a sulfuric acid molecule, a formic acid molecule, a nitric acid molecule, an ammonia molecule, a dimethylamine molecule, and 0–5 water molecules, we have completed an exhaustive search of the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS//ωB97X-D/6-31++G** Gibbs free energy surface for this system. We find that the detailed geometries of each minimum free energy cluster are often more important than traditional acid or base strength. Addition of a water molecule to a dry cluster can enhance stabilization, and we find that the (SA)(NA)(A)(DMA)(W) cluster has special stability. Equilibrium calculations of SA, FA, NA, A, DMA, and water using our quantum chemical ΔG° values for cluster formation and realistic estimates of the concentrations of these monomers in the atmosphere reveals that nitric acid can drive early stages of particle formation just as efficiently as sulfuric acid. Our results lead us to believe that particle formation in the atmosphere results from the combination of many different molecules that are able to form highly stable complexes with acid molecules such as SA, NA, and FA.",

A decrease in the stability of the complex was observed with an increase in EtOH concentration in the solvent, and the change in the Gibbs energy of the complex formation is controlled by the enthalpy factor. The increase of the entropy contribution to the change in the Gibbs energy of the [Rut ⊂ HP-β-CD] complex formation reaction is probably caused by an increase in the number of free water molecules as a result of the Rut and HP-β-CD desolvation in aqueous-ethanol solvents. The effect of different solvents such as water and ethanol was included via the analytical linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (ALPB) model, which was implemented in the GFN2-xTB code. The effect of solvent on the rutin’s ability to interact with HP-β-CD is decreasing in the following order: water > ethanol.",

The development of new electrolytes for SIBs is imperative since it impacts battery life and capacity. Currently, sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) is used as the benchmark salt, but is highly hygroscopic and generates toxic HF. This work describes the synthesis of a series of sodium borate salts, with electrochemical studies revealing that Na[B(hfip)4]⋅DME (hfip=hexafluoroisopropyloxy, OiPrF) and Na[B(pp)2] (pp=perfluorinated pinacolato, O2C2(CF3)4) have excellent electrochemical performance. The [B(pp)2]− anion also exhibits a high tolerance to air and water. Both electrolytes give more stable electrode-electrolyte interfaces than conventionally used NaPF6, as demonstrated by impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, they give greater cycling stability and comparable capacity to NaPF6 for SIBs, as shown in commercial pouch cells.",

Solubility reduction of elemental sulfur in H2S is the main reason of sulfur deposition. To understand how elemental sulfur, which exists in the form of sulfur clusters (Sn), interacts with H2S, quantum chemistry calculations are performed to study the structures and thermodynamic properties of Sn–H2S complexes. Weak interaction resulting mainly from intermolecular sulfur–sulfur interaction is revealed for these complexes. The complexes formed by S4, S6 and S8 have similar binding energies that are relatively higher than that of S2–H2S. Because of their small binding energies and Gibbs free energies, these complexes may coexist in formation, but are however easily decomposed or formed depending on stratigraphic or pipeline conditions. Our calculations reveal the status of elemental sulfur in H2S, which is useful for subsequent predictions on sulfur solubility and sulfur deposition in high sulfur-content natural gas formation.",

The process was explored using alcohols in the absence of H2. Solvothermally prepared zirconium(IV) metal organic frameworks (Zr-MOFs) of DUT-52 (DUT: Dresden University of Technology) and UiO-66 (UiO: University of Oslo) were employed in the CTH. Energetic studies (GFN2-xTB level) revealed a similar Gibbs free energy of DUT-52 and UiO-66 when they were reacted by 2-propanol. Electrostatic potential (ESP) charges and Wiberg bond order (WBO) calculations showed that two Zr atoms available for FALD coordination had higher Lewis acidity in DUT-52 than UiO-66. DUT-52 successfully gave >99% of FOL in 3 h at 160 °C under 2-propanol with Ea of 61 kJ/mol and an equal turnover frequency (TOF) to UiO-66 (5.4 h−1). DUT-52 was also easily recyclable up to the 4th run with no significant performance loss.",

Polybenzimidazole (PBI) has been widely used for OSN membrane fabrication owing to its excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and resistance in various organic solvents. However, pristine PBI membranes show unsatisfactory stability in polar aprotic solvents. To circumvent this issue, extensive research has been conducted on the covalent crosslinking of PBI membranes. Herein, to develop a more sustainable crosslinking strategy, difunctional organic acids — oxalic and squaric acids — were used for the reversible crosslinking of PBI membranes in water at room temperature, affording robust membranes with long-term stability in polar aprotic solvents. An analysis at the molecular level of the difunctional acid crosslinking system based on pKa values and binding energies was presented. The molecular weight cutoff and solvent flux of the PBI membranes crosslinked with oxalic and squaric acids were 779 and 844 g mol−1 and 153.9 and 139.7 L m−2 h−1 bar−1 in N,N-dimethylacetamide at 30 bar, respectively. The crosslinking was successfully reversed under basic conditions, allowing the recovery of the pristine PBI polymer. A sustainability assessment revealed the advantages of the proposed crosslinking system over conventional covalent crosslinking approaches.",

Among the 9 clusters studied here, only (CO2)2–CO was previously observed by high-resolution spectroscopy. The spectra, which occur in the region of the ν3 fundamental of CO2 (≈2350 cm−1), were recorded using a tunable optical parametric oscillator source to probe a pulsed supersonic slit jet expansion. The trimers (CO2)2–CO and (CO2)2–N2 have structures in which the CO or N2 is aligned along the symmetry axis of a staggered side-by-side CO2 dimer unit. The observation of two fundamental bands for (CO2)2–CO and (CO2)2–N2 shows that this CO2 dimer unit is non-planar, unlike (CO2)2 itself. For the trimers CO2–(CO)2 and CO2–(N2)2, the CO or N2 monomers occupy equivalent positions in the ‘equatorial plane’ of the CO2, pointing toward its C atom. To form the tetramers CO2–(CO)3 and CO2–(N2)3, a third CO or N2 monomer is then added off to the ‘side’ of the first two. In the mixed tetramers CO2–(CO)2–N2 and CO2–CO–(N2)2, this ‘side’ position is taken by N2 and not CO. In addition to the fundamental bands, combination bands are also observed for (CO2)2–CO, CO2–(CO)2, and CO2–(N2)2, yielding some information about their low-frequency intermolecular vibrations.",

Compared with traditional separation methods, membrane separation could achieve higher efficiency with less energy. In this work, we reported graphene oxide (GO) membrane with charged interlayer channels for separation of mono-/di-valent ions by utilizing the synergistic effect of size-sieving and electrostatic repulsion. Positively-charged polyethyleneimine (PEI) were introduced into the interlayer of negatively charged GO layers via layer-by-layer assembly. Characterizations indicated that the introduction of PEI not only controlled the charge property of the interlayer channels, but also increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface. The effects of the number of GO-PEI bi-layer, PEI concentration and salt concentration on the membrane performance for mono-/di-valent ions were systematically investigated. The optimal GO-PEI membrane with ∼100 nm thick exhibited K+, Na+, and Li+ permeation rates of 0.474, 0.378, and 0.306 mol m−2 h−1, as well as the selectivity for K+/Mg2+, Na+/Mg2+, and Li+/Mg2+ of 33.8, 27.0, and 21.9, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) was employed to understand the transport mechanism of charged interlayer channels for selective transport of monovalent ions over divalent ions.",

Despite the apparent cooperative mechanism of 1 and 2, AFM imaging and SAXS measurements reveal the formation of small aggregates that suggest the operation of an anti-cooperative mechanism strongly conditioned by an attenuated growth. In this mechanism, the formation of the nuclei is favoured over the subsequent addition of monomeric units to the aggregate, which finally results in short aggregates. Theoretical calculations show that both the BDT and BODIPY motifs, after forming the initial dimeric nuclei, experience a strong distortion of the central aromatic backbone upon growth, which makes the addition of successive monomeric units unfavourable and impedes the formation of long fibrillar structures. Despite the anti-cooperativity observed in the supramolecular polymerization of 1 and 2, the combination of both self-assembling units results in the formation of small co-assembled aggregates with a similar supramolecular polymerization behaviour to that observed for the separate components.",

However, still unclear is the influence of different exposed facets of the cellulose nanocrystals on the physicochemical properties. Herein, we first designed cellulose II nanocrystals with different exposed facets, the hydroxymethyl conformations distribution, hydrogen bond (HB) analysis, as well as the relative structural stability of these models (including crystal facets {A, B, O} and Type-A models vary in size) are theoretically investigated. The results reveal that the HB network of terminal anhydroglucose depends on the adjacent chain’s contact sites in nanocrystals exposed with different facets. Compared to nanocrystals exposed with inclined facet, these exposed with flat facet tend to be the most stable. Therefore, the strategy of tuning exposed crystal facets will guide the design of novel cellulose nanocrystals with various physicochemical properties.",

Sub nanometer clusters are relatively less explored for their catalytic activity on account of undercoordinated surface structure. Taking this into account, we studied platinum-based sub nanometer clusters for their catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A comprehensive analysis with global optimization is carried out for structural prediction of the platinum clusters. The energetic and electronic properties of interactions of clusters with reaction intermediates are investigated. The role of structural sensitivity in the dynamics of clusters is unraveled, and unique intermediate specific interactions are identified. ORR energetics is examined, and exceptional activity for sub nanometer clusters are observed. An inverse size versus activity relationship is identified, challenging the conventional trends followed by larger nanoclusters. The principal role of atomicity in governing the catalytic activity of nanoclusters is illustrated. The structural norms governing the sub nanometer cluster activity are shown to be markedly different from larger nanoclusters.",

Our results indicate that (i) the effect of non-neighboring bases on the inter-strand interaction is negligibly small, (ii) London dispersion effects are essential for the stability of the duplex structure, (iii) the largest contribution to the stability of the duplex structure is the Watson–Crick base pairing – consistent with previous computational investigations, (iv) the effect of stacking between adjacent bases is relatively small but still essential for the duplex structure stability and (v) there are no cooperativity effects between intra-strand stacking and inter-strand base pairing interactions. These results are consistent with atomic force microscope measurements and provide the first theoretical validation of nearest neighbor approaches for predicting thermodynamic data of arbitrary DNA sequences.",

Herein, inspired by the afterglow RTP of natural basswood, we prepare a series of sustainable afterglow RTP materials by confining lignin within a 3D poly(acrylic acid) network that mimics the wood matrix. The RTP emission of these materials could be finely tuned either by varying the drying temperature or the crosslinking density. Afterglow RTP emission could also be produced by embedding different types of lignin in a variety of 3D polymeric networks, thus demonstrating the generality of our strategy for preparing sustainable lignin-based RTP materials. As an illustration of potential applications, the lignin-based RTP materials are used to coat cotton fibers, which are then incorporated into luminescent textiles.",

In a healthy man, the normal level of UA in urine is in mM range where as in serum it is in µM range. So far, many electrochemical sensors have been developed for the UA determination but the interferential species such as ascorbic acid (AA) and dopamine (DA) have greatly affected the UA oxidation due to their similar electroactive properties. In this work, highly sensitive, selective and reproducible electrochemical UA sensors was proposed, using graphene (Gr) sheets, Cu(II)-polydopamine (PDA) complex and Cu nanoparticles (denoted as CuNPs/Cu(II)-PDA/Gr). In particular, a Geometry, Frequency, Non-covalent, eXtended Tight Binding (GFN2-xTB) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies were performed to provide reasonable explanations of reactive/catalytic sites, the interaction as well as structure of CuNPs/Cu(II)-PDA/Gr. The key role of each individual component in the sensing interface was thoroughly discussed and closely correlated with theoretical quantum calculations. To our best knowledge, this is the first study reporting not only such a simple however best performing design for electrochemical UA sensor (wide linear range, low detection limit, excellent selectivity, reproducibility) but also the application of GFN2-xTB, DFT quantum calculations in elucidating the working principle of the each component as well as the whole sensor.",

            "abstract": "The engineering of supramolecular architectures needs accurate descriptions of the intermolecular interactions in crystal structures. Tetra­thia­fulvalene (TTF) is an effective building block used in the construction of promising functional materials. The parallel packing of the neutral TTF–TTF system was studied previously using the high-level quantum chemical method, advancing it as a valuable model system. The recently developed tight-binding quantum chemical method GFN2-xTB and local coupled-cluster method DLPNO-CCSD(T) were used to investigate the stacking interactions of TTF and selected derivatives deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database. Using the interaction energy of the TTF–TTF dimer calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level as the reference, the accuracies of the two methods are investigated. The energy decom­position analysis within the DLPNO-CCSD(T) framework reveals the importance of dispersion interaction in the TTF-related stacking systems. The dispersion interaction density plot vividly shows the magnitude and distribution of the dispersion interaction, providing a revealing insight into the stacking interactions in crystal structures. The results show that the GFN2-xTB and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods could achieve accuracy at an affordable com­putational cost, which would be valuable in understanding the nature of parallel stacking in supra­molecular systems.",

Here, we report on the results of first-principles calculations, based on density functional theory (DFT) including dispersion, of the adsorption energies and configurations of the five nucleobases, molecules conforming nucleotides in nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, on the oxygen-terminated titanium carbide MXene surface (Ti2CO2), chosen as a prototype MXene due to titanium being the most biocompatible transition metal. We find that physisorption is the most likely mechanism of adsorption on the Ti2CO2 (0001) basal surface, with the molecules sitting parallel to the MXene, about 2.5 Å away. The calculated adsorption energies and Bader charge transfer values are moderate, as desired for sensing applications. We find a fair correlation between the adsorption energies and the van der Waals volumes of the nucleobases, hinting towards an adsorption dominated by van der Waals interactions. No structural deformation is observed on the molecules or on the surface. Thus, all of our conclusions support the potential applicability of the Ti2CO2 MXene as a suitable nucleobase sensor.",

To address this challenge, efficient visible light-active photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of biomass-derived platform chemical is highly desirable. Herein, selective oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) was achieved by visible light-driven photocatalysis over titania. Pristine titania is photocatalytically inactive under visible light, so an unconventional approach was employed for the visible light (λ=515 nm) sensitization of titania via a formation of a visible light-absorbing complex of HMF (substrate) on the titania surface. Surface-complexation of HMF on titania mediated ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) under visible light, which efficiently catalyzed the oxidation of HMF to DFF. A high DFF selectivity of 87 % was achieved with 59 % HMF conversion after 4 h of illumination. The apparent quantum yield obtained for DFF production was calculated to be 6.3 %. It was proposed that the dissociative interaction of hydroxyl groups of HMF and the titania surface is responsible for the surface-complex formation. When the hydroxyl groups of titania were modified via surface-fluorination or calcination the oxidation of HMF was inhibited under visible light, signifying that hydroxyl groups are decisive for photocatalytic activity.",

With a highly efficient implementation of the linear complex polarization propagator, we have performed Hartree–Fock and Kohn–Sham density functional theory calculations of the frequency-dependent polarizabilities for fullerenes consisting of up to 540 carbon atoms. Our results for the static polarizabilities and C6 coefficients show scalings of N1.2 and N2.2, respectively, thereby deviating significantly from the previously reported values obtained with the use of semi-classical/empirical methods. Arguably, our reported values are the most accurate to date as they represent the first ab initio or first-principles treatment of fullerenes up to a convincing system size.",

            "abstract": "The evolution of gaseous products is a feature common to several electrochemical processes, often resulting in bubbles adhering to the electrode’s surface. Adherent bubbles reduce the electrode active area, and are therefore generally treated as electrochemically inert entities. Here, we show that this general assumption does not hold for gas bubbles masking anodes operating in water. By means of imaging electrochemiluminescent systems, and by studying the anisotropy of polymer growth around bubbles, we demonstrate that gas cavities adhering to an electrode surface initiate the oxidation of water-soluble species more effectively than electrode areas free of bubbles. The corona of a bubble accumulates hydroxide anions, unbalanced by cations, a phenomenon which causes the oxidation of hydroxide ions to hydroxyl radicals to occur at potentials at least 0.7 V below redox tabled values. The downhill shift of the hydroxide oxidation at the corona of the bubble is likely to be a general mechanism involved in the initiation of heterogeneous electrochemical reactions in water, and could be harnessed in chemical synthesis.",

Then, the relationship between the Moiré pattern and the chiral properties of BLG is revealed by the visualization method. We found that the energy level of the Moiré pattern is between the orbital energy levels of the zigzag and the armchair edges, and the addition of Moiré can significantly enhance the interlayer charge transfer of normal BLG and twisted BLG. Moiré itself has a local effect on charge transfer excitons and local excitons on BLG. Moreover, the Moiré can effectively regulate the distribution of the magnetic transition dipole moment to control the chirality of twisted bilayer graphene (TwBLG). These laws will help the application of TwBLG in optical and optoelectronic devices. These regulars will guide the design and manufacture of TwBLG-based optoelectronic, photobiological, and photochemical reaction devices.",

The cationic assemblies were obtained as salts of different fluorinated anions with diverse sizes and electronic properties, namely BF4−, PF6−, SbF6− and CF3SO3−. The new crown-like metallamacrocycles showed remarkable differences in their NMR spectra due to the presence of the different counteranions. On the basis of the observed variations, the metallacycles have been tested as catalytic precursors in allylic alkylation reactions. The anion-dependent activity and selectivity has been analysed and compared with that of the corresponding monometallic allylic corners [Pd(η3-2-Me-C3H4)(4-PPh2py)2]X (X=BF4−, PF6−, SbF6−, CF3SO3−). DFT calculations have been employed in order to help to the interpretation of the experimental data and to model the anion–crown interactions.",

            "abstract": "Abiotic allosterism is most commonly observed in hetero-bimetallic supramolecular complexes and less frequently in homo-bimetallic complexes. The use of hemilabile ligands with high synthetic complexity enables the catalytic center by the addition or removal of allosteric effectors and simplicity is unusually seen in these systems. Here we describe a simpler approach to achieve kinetic regulation by the use of dimeric Schiff base copper complexes connected by a chlorido ligand bridge. The chlorido ligand acts as a weak link between monomers, generating homo-bimetallic self-aggregating supramolecular complexes that generate monomeric species in different reaction rates depending on the solvent and on the radical moiety of the ligand. The ligand exchange was observed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and conductivity measurements, indicating that complexes with ligands bearing methoxyl (CuIIL2) and ethoxyl (CuIIL5) radicals were more prone to form dimeric complexes in comparison to ligands bearing hydrogen (CuIIL1), methyl (CuIIL3), or t-butyl (CuIIL4) radicals. The equilibrium between dimer and monomer afforded different reactivities of the complexes in acetonitrile/water and methanol/water mixtures toward urea hydrolysis as a model reaction. It was evident that the dimeric species were inactive and that by increasing the water concentration in the reaction medium, the dimeric structures dissociated to form the active monomeric structures. This behavior was more pronounced when methanol/water mixtures were employed due to a slower displacement of the chlorido bridge in this medium than in the acetonitrile/water mixtures, enabling the reaction kinetics to be evaluated. This effect was attributed to the preferential solvation shell by the organic solvents and in essence, an upregulation behavior was observed due to the intrinsic nature of the complexes to form dimeric structures in solution that could be dismantled in the presence of water, indicating their possible use as water-sensors in organic solvents.",

Most of the chromogenic groups in organic dye, especially for cationic molecules, are nitrogenous groups, and their reduction is easy to form toxic amines. Realizing the special removal of these contaminants from wastewater is of great significance nowadays. β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) as an environmentally friendly and inexpensive supramolecular host compound is usually used for selectively encapsulating various molecules through the supramolecular inclusion. Herein the supramolecular inclusion technology for the removal of cationic organic dye pollutants in wastewater was proposed using a novel water-insoluble β-CD derivative as a case study. Five alkoxydifluoro-p-phthalonitrile substituted β-CDs (Rx-β-CDs) were synthesized through the two-step aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction. The structural characterizations indicate that these water-insoluble Rx-β-CDs are mono-substituted products with a small surface area of less than 10 m2 g−1. The removal performances of Rx-β-CD for cationic, anionic and electrically neutral organic dye pollutants were approached systematically. It was found that Rx-β-CD was highly efficient for removing the cationic pollutants. The removal of cationic methylene blue was very fast and could reach equilibrium of close to 100% within 1–3 min. The removal mechanism was confirmed that the special removal of cationic organic dye pollutants by Rx-β-CD is a supramolecular inclusion process. This study sets up a new method for selectively removing cationic organic contaminants from wastewater.",
