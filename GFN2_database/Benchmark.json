            "abstract": "Pyranose ring pucker is a key coordinate governing the structure, interactions and reactivity of carbohydrates. We assess the ability of the machine learning potentials, ANI-1ccx and ANI-2x, and the GFN2-xTB semiempirical quantum chemical method, to model ring pucker conformers of five monosaccharides and oxane in the gas phase. Relative to coupled-cluster quantum mechanical calculations, we find that ANI-1ccx most accurately reproduces the ring pucker energy landscape for these molecules, with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0.83. This correlation in relative energies lowers to values of 0.70 for ANI-2x and 0.60 for GFN2-xTB. The ANI-1ccx also provides the most accurate estimate of the energetics of the 4C1-to-1C4 minimum energy pathway for the six molecules. All three models reproduce chair more accurately than non-chair geometries. Analysis of small model molecules suggests that the ANI-1ccx model favors puckers with equatorial hydrogen bonding substituents; that ANI-2x and GFN2-xTB models overstabilize conformers with axially oriented groups; and that the endo-anomeric effect is overestimated by the machine learning models and underestimated via the GFN2-xTB method. While the pucker conformers considered in this study correspond to a gas phase environment, the accuracy and computational efficiency of the ANI-1ccx approach in modeling ring pucker in vacuo provides a promising basis for future evaluation and application to condensed phase environments.",

            "abstract": "Photochromic molecules are widely studied and developed for their many potential applications. To optimize the required properties through theoretical models, a considerable chemical space is to be explored, and their environment in devices is to be accounted for.. To this end, cheap and reliable computational methods can be powerful tools to steer synthetic developments. As ab initio methods remain costly for extensive studies (in terms of the size of the system and/or number of molecules), semiempirical methods such as density functional tight-binding (TB) could offer a good compromise between accuracy computational cost. However, these approaches necessitate benchmarking on the families of compounds of interest. Thus, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the accuracy of several key features calculated with TB methods (DFTB2, DFTB3, GFN2-xTB, and LC-DFTB2) for three sets of photochromic organic molecules: azobenzene (AZO), norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC), and dithienylethene (DTE) derivatives. The features considered here are the optimized geometries, the difference in energy between the two isomers (ΔE), and of the energies of the first relevant excited states. All the TB results are compared to those obtained with DFT methods and state-of-the-art electronic structure calculation methods: DLPNO-CCSD(T) for ground states and DLPNO-STEOM-CCSD for excited states. Our results show that, overall, DFTB3 is the TB method leading to the best results for the geometries and the ΔE values and can be used alone for these purposes for NBD/QC and DTE derivatives. Single point calculations at the r2SCAN-3c level using TB geometries allow circumventing the deficiencies of the TB methods in the AZO series. For electronic transition calculations, the range separated LC-DFTB2 method is the most accurate TB method tested for AZO and NBD/QC derivatives, in close agreement with the reference.",

            "abstract": "The activation, storage, and separation of gases and fuels are closely related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the widespread use of renewable energies, and the application of industrial gases. Metal–organic frameworks (MOF) and porous organic cages (POC) are an emerging class of crystalline porous materials that show promising characteristics in this field. Yet, their accurate theoretical description poses a challenge to existing methods due to the sheer size of the pores and cages as well as their often complex structure. In this work, the performance of generally applicable density functional approximations (DFAs), semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods, and force fields (FFs) for the calculation of binding energies of various gases in molecular cutouts of MOFs and POCs is tested with reference to high-level PBE0-D4/def2-TZVP hybrid DFT energies. Therefore, favorable binding sites for greenhouse gases (CO2), energy-related gases (H2, methanol, and benzene), and industrial gases (N2) are determined by an efficient conformer search algorithm (CREST). The resulting structures are further optimized by DFT (B97-3c), semiempirical (GFN2-xTB), and force-field (GFN-FF) methods to yield the binding sites and corresponding energies. With mean absolute deviations ranging from 1.1 to 1.4 kcal mol–1 for all tested systems, the considered GFN methods reach an accuracy remarkably close to the DFT reference, justifying their application for efficient binding site screening. In comparison, the widely used PMx methods show on average 1.0 kcal mol–1 larger deviations. Furthermore, the application of single-point, multilevel approaches and the parallelism of potential energy surfaces are discussed.",

We investigate the performance of semiempirical quantum mechanical GFN tight-binding and force-field methods for the calculation of gas-phase infrared spectra in comparison to experiment and low-cost (B3LYP-3c) density functional theory. A data set of 7247 experimental references was used to evaluate method performance based on automatic spectra comparison. Various quantitative spectral similarity measures were employed for the comparison between theory and experiment and for determining empirical scaling factors. It is shown that the scaling of atomic masses provides an accurate yet simple alternative to standard global frequency scaling in density functional theory (DFT) and semiempirical calculations. Furthermore, the method performance for 58 exemplary transition metal complexes was investigated. The efficient DFT composite method B3LYP-3c, that was introduced in the course of this work, was found to be excellently suited for general IR spectra calculations. The GFN1- and GFN2-xTB tight-binding methods clearly outperformed the PMx competitors. Conformational changes were investigated for a subset of the data and are found to have a mediocre strong influence on the simulated spectra suggesting that the corresponding elaborate sampling steps may be neglected in automated compound identification workflows.",

The effect of varying QM region size and choice of embedding potentials, including fixed-charge and polarizable molecular mechanics force fields (TIP3P and EFP) and various semiempirical QM methods (PM7, GFN2-xTB, DFTBA, DFTB3, HF-3c, and PBEh-3c), on the accuracy of the models was examined. A surprising finding was that molecular mechanics force fields outperformed many of the semiempirical methods. Generally, the errors in the QM/QM′ and QM/MM models converge slowly with respect to the QM region size, requiring 50 or more waters to be included in the QM region before the error in the model falls below 1 kcal mol–1 of its pure QM result. Different QM region selection schemes were also compared, and it was found that selection based on Natural Population Analysis (NPA) atomic charges significantly reduced the error in the QM/QM′ and QM/MM models particularly if a low-quality embedding potential was used. It is envisaged that these results will be useful for the development of future hybrid QM models.",

Five charge descriptors, three charge models, three solvent models, gas-phase calculations, several DFT methods (a combination of eight DFT functionals and fifteen basis sets), and four different semiempirical approaches were tested. Among those, the best combination to reproduce experimental pKa’s is to compute the natural population analysis atomic charge using the solvation model based on density model at the M06L/6-311G(d,p) level of theory and selecting the maximum atomic charge on the carboxylic oxygen atoms (R2 = 0.955). The applicability of the suggested protocol and its stability along geometrical changes are verified by molecular dynamics simulations performed for a set of aspartate, glutamate, and alanine peptides. By reporting the calculated atomic charge of the carboxylate form into the linear relationship derived in this work, it should be possible to accurately estimate the amino acid’s pKa’s in a protein environment.",

Information on the repulsive parts of the potential energy surface is crucial for the development of robust empirically parametrized computational methods. We use the new data set of highly accurate CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies to test selected density functional theory (DFT) and semiempirical quantum-mechanical methods. The double-hybrid functionals were the best performing, with the revDSD-PBEP86-D3 being the most accurate DFT method, followed by the range-separated ωB97X functionals. Out of semiempirical methods, GFN2-xTB yielded the best results. On the example of the PM6 method, we analyze the source of error and its relation to the difficulties in the description of conformational energies, and we also devise an immediately applicable correction that fixes the most serious uncorrected issues previously encountered in practical calculations.",

            "abstract": "Computational quantum chemistry provides fundamental chemical and physical insights into solvated reaction mechanisms across many areas of chemistry, especially in homogeneous and heterogeneous renewable energy catalysis. Such reactions may depend on explicit interactions with ions and solvent molecules that are nontrivial to characterize. Rigorously modeling explicit solvent effects with molecular dynamics usually brings steep computational costs while the performance of continuum solvent models such as polarizable continuum model (PCM), charge-asymmetric nonlocally determined local-electric (CANDLE), conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), and effective screening medium method with the reference interaction site model (ESM-RISM) are less well understood for reaction mechanisms. Here, we revisit a fundamental aqueous hydride transfer reaction—carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction by sodium borohydride (NaBH4)—as a test case to evaluate how different solvent models perform in aqueous phase charge migrations that would be relevant to renewable energy catalysis mechanisms. For this system, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations almost exactly reproduced energy profiles from QM simulations, and the Na+ counterion in the QM/MM simulations plays an insignificant role over ensemble averaged trajectories that describe the reaction pathway. However, solvent models used on static calculations gave much more variability in data depending on whether the system was modeled using explicit solvent shells and/or the counterion. We pinpoint this variability due to unphysical descriptions of charge-separated states in the gas phase (i.e., self-interaction errors), and we show that using more accurate hybrid functionals and/or explicit solvent shells lessens these errors. This work closes with recommended procedures for treating solvation in future computational efforts in studying renewable energy catalysis mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen abstraction is one of the crucial initial key steps in the combustion of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For an accurate theoretical prediction of heterogeneous combustion processes, larger systems need to be treated as compared to pure gas phase reactions. We address here the question on how transferable activation and reaction energies computed for small molecular models are to larger polyaromatics. The approximate transferability of energy contributions is a key assumption for multiscale modeling approaches. To identify efficient levels of accuracy, we start with accurate coupled-cluster and density functional theory (DFT) calculations for different sizes of polyaromatics. More approximate methods as the reactive force-field ReaxFF and the extended semi-empirical tight binding (xTB) methods are then benchmarked against these data sets in terms of reaction energies and equilibrium geometries. Furthermore, we analyze the role of bond-breaking and relaxation energies, vibrational contributions, and post-Hartree-Fock correlation corrections on the reaction, and for the activation energies, we analyze the validity of the Bell-Evans-Polanyi and Hammond principles. First, we find good transferability for this process and that the predictivity of small models at high theoretical levels is way superior than any approximate method can deliver. Second, ReaxFF can serve as a qualitative exploration method, whereas GFN2-xTB in combination with GFN1-xTB appears as a favorable tool to bridge between DFT and ReaxFF so that we propose a multimethod scheme with employing ReaxFF, GFN1/GFN2-xTB, DFT, and coupled cluster to cope effectively with such a complex reactive system.",

            "abstract": "The calculation of redox potentials by semiempirical quantum mechanical (SQM) approaches is evaluated with a focus on the recently developed GFNn-xTB methods. The assessment is based on a data set comprising 313 experimental redox potentials of small to medium-sized organic and organometallic molecules in various solvents. This compilation is termed as ROP313 (reduction and oxidation potentials 313) and divided for analysis purposes into the organic subset OROP and the organometallic subset OMROP. Corresponding data for a few common density functional theory (DFT) functionals employing extended AO basis sets and small basis-set DFT composite schemes are computed for comparison. Continuum solvation models are used to calculate the important solvation free energy contribution. The results for ROP313 show that the GFNn-xTB methods provide a robust, efficient, and generally applicable workflow for the routine calculation of redox potentials. The GFNn-xTB methods outperform the PMx competitor for the OROP subset (mean absolute deviation from the experiment, MADGFN2-xTB = 0.30 V, MADGFN1-xTB = 0.31 V, PM6-D3H4 = 0.61 V, PM7 = 0.60 V), almost reaching low-cost DFT quality (MADB97-3c = 0.25 V) at drastically reduced computational cost (2–3 orders of magnitude). All SQM methods perform considerably worse for the OMROP subset. Here, the GFN2-xTB still yields semiquantitative results slightly better and more robustly than with the PMx methods (MADGFN2-xTB = 0.74 V, PM6-D3H4 = 0.78 V, PM7 = 0.82 V). The proposed workflow enables large-scale quantum chemical computations of organic and, to a lesser extent, organometallic molecule redox potentials on common laptop computers in seconds to minutes of computation time enabling, e.g., screening of extended compound libraries.",

            "abstract": "Halogen bonds are noncovalent interactions that have been widely used in many fields, including drug design, crystal engineering, and material sciences. A clear understanding of the nature of halogen bonding as well as the proper theoretical bonding description, especially the development of efficient and accurate computational chemical methods and their application in complex systems, is of great significance to promote the development of related fields. In this perspective, we reviewed the investigations of the nature of halogen bonding in recent years and discussed the development of quantum mechanical, molecular mechanical, and empirical scoring function methods in properly describing halogen-bonding interactions, as well as their achievements in corresponding areas. An evaluation on the performance of various quantum mechanical and semiempirical quantum mechanical methods in describing halogen bonds was also included, involving the DFT-D4 scheme and the recently reported xTB methods. We hope this perspective may be helpful, from the insights of computational tools and methods, in providing reference and enlightenment for the application of halogen bonds in fields like high-throughput virtual screening and rational drug design.",

Both data sets are complemented by 10-point dissociation curves (HB375×10, IHB100×10). The interaction energies are extrapolated to the CCSD(T)/CBS limit from calculations in large basis sets. The Article also summarizes the design principles that will be used to construct the subsequent data sets in the series. The testing of DFT-D methods on the HB375 set has revealed interesting, previously unnoticed issues. The application of the new data to the testing and parametrization of semiempirical QM methods is also discussed.",

From these, composite benchmark interaction energies are also built for complexes of the ligand with the complete active site of the protein (PLA15 data set). These data sets are used to test multiple SQM methods with corrections for noncovalent interactions; the role of the solvation model in the calculations is tested as well.",

            "abstract": "In the present study, we have investigated factors affecting the accuracy of computational chemistry calculation of redox potentials, namely the gas-phase ionization energy (IE) and electron affinity (EA), and the continuum solvation effect. In general, double-hybrid density functional theory methods yield IEs and EAs that are on average within 0.1 eV of our high-level W3X-L benchmark, with the best performing method being DSD-BLYP/ma-def2-QZVPP. For lower-cost methods, the average errors are 0.2–0.3 eV, with ωB97X-3c being the most accurate ( 0.15 eV). For the solvation component, essentially all methods have an average error of 0.3 eV, which shows the limitation of the continuum solvation model. Curiously, the directly calculated redox potentials show errors of 0.3 eV for all methods. These errors are notably smaller than what can be expected from error propagation with the two components (IE and EA, and solvation effect). Such a discrepancy can be attributed to the cancellation of errors, with the lowest-cost GFN2-xTB method benefiting the most, and the most accurate ωB97X-3c method benefiting the least. For organometallic species, the redox potentials show large deviations exceeding 0.5 eV even for DSD-BLYP. The large errors are attributed to those for the gas-phase IEs and EAs, which represents a major barrier to the accurate calculation of redox potentials for such systems.",

            "abstract": "The high-throughput exploration and screening of molecules for organic electronics involves either a ‘top-down’ curation and mining of existing repositories, or a ‘bottom-up’ assembly of user-defined fragments based on known synthetic templates. Both are time-consuming approaches requiring significant resources to compute electronic properties accurately. Here, ‘top-down‘ is combined with ‘bottom-up‘ through automatic assembly and statistical models, thus providing a platform for the fragment-based discovery of organic electronic materials. This study generates a top-down set of 117K synthesized molecules containing structures, electronic and topological properties and chemical composition, and uses them as building blocks for bottom-up design. A tool is developed to automate the coupling of these building blocks at their C(sp2/sp)-H bonds, providing a fundamental link between the two dataset construction philosophies. Statistical models are trained on this dataset and a subset of resulting top-down/bottom-up compounds, enabling on-the-fly prediction of ground and excited state properties with high accuracy across organic compound space. With access to ab initio-quality optical properties, this bottom-up pipeline may be applied to any materials design campaign using existing compounds as building blocks. To illustrate this, over a million molecules are screened for singlet fission. tThe leading candidates provide insight into the features promoting this multiexciton-generating process.",

Peters systems are studied in the perspective of an environmentally friendly ammonia synthesis alternative to the Haber-Bosch process. The problem that lowers the effectiveness of the Peters system-based catalysis is the poisoning of the catalyst itself, due to hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we examine how nitrogen and hydrogen molecule interact with the Peters systems using density functional theory (DFT), QTAIM analysis, and xTB methods. The energetics of the interaction and reaction, bond distances, and QTAIM parameters are considered. The xTB method is used for geometry optimization and is compared with the results of the DFT method. It is found that the xTB H0 Hamiltonian tuning needs to be employed to improve performance of this approach when compared against DFT (e.g. to avoid the dissociation of the H-H bond).",

Presented here is a new single-parameter interaction energy model (CE-1p), extending the previous CrystalExplorer energy model and calibrated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the ωB97M-V/def2-QZVP level over 1157 intermolecular interactions from 147 crystal structures. The new model incorporates an improved treatment of dispersion interactions and polarizabilities using the exchange-hole dipole model (XDM), along with the use of effective core potentials (ECPs), facilitating application to molecules containing elements across the periodic table (from H to Rn). This new model is validated against high-level reference data with outstanding performance, comparable to state-of-the-art DFT methods for molecular crystal lattice energies over the X23 set (mean absolute deviation 3.6 kJ mol−1) and for intermolecular interactions in the S66x8 benchmark set (root mean-square deviation 3.3 kJ mol−1). The performance of this model is further examined compared to the GFN2-xTB tight-binding model, providing recommendations for the evaluation of intermolecular interactions in molecular crystal systems.",

            "abstract": "Resorcin[4]arenes (R[4]A) are a group of macrocyclic compounds whose peculiar feature is the presence of eight hydroxyl groups in their structure. The directional formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds with their participation leads to the formation of a cyclochiral racemic mixture of these compounds. Their stability strongly depends on the substituent and especially the environment in which they are located. The paper discusses the cyclochiral nature of aminomethylene derivatives of R[4]A (AMD-R[4]A). Their cyclochiral rigidity in non-polar solvents has been shown. The influence of the size of the alkyl groups in the amino substituents of AMD-R[4]A on their cyclochiral nature was noted. To calculate the reaction paths for their racemization, the nudged elastic band (NEB) method was employed using the semi-empirical DFT (GFN1-xTB) approach. The calculated activation barrier energies for their racemization in chloroform, obtained through various semi-empirical quantum chemical methods (SE), Hartree–Fock (HF), and density functionals theory (DFT), show good correlation with experimental observations. Among the tested methods, the B38LYP-D4 method is highly recommended due to its fast computational speed and accuracy, which is comparable to the time-consuming double-hybrid DH-revDSD-PBEP86 approach.",

We created an extensive library of 36 different complexes, which were characterized at semi-empirical and DFT levels. Semi-empirical geometries and dimerization energies compare well against reference data or Density Functional Theory calculations we performed. Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics was used to understand what happens when two molecules of the buckycatcher meet, allowing us to infer on the lack of kinetic barriers when dimers form. Thermodynamically, it is possible that room temperature solutions contain dimerized buckycatcher. Using a very simple exchange model, it is shown, however, that dimerization cannot compete thermodynamically against complexation with fullerenes, which accounts for experimental observations.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the relative stability of increasingly large helicenes at the CCSD(T) level via the high-level G4(MP2) thermochemical protocol. The relative energies of [n]helicenes (n = 4–9) are obtained via the following reaction: [n]helicene + benzene → [n + 1]helicene + ethene. This reaction conserves the number of sp2-hybridized carbons, the number of aromatic rings, and the helical structures on the two sides of the reaction. We show that the reaction energy converges to an asymptotic value of ΔH298 = + 22.4 kJ/mol for increasingly large helicenes. For comparison, for [n]acenes, the same reaction converges to a much higher asymptotic reaction enthalpy of ΔH298 = + 56.8 kJ/mol. This difference between the two asymptotic reaction enthalpies sheds light on the relative thermodynamic stability of increasingly large helicenes. We proceed to use the G4(MP2) reaction energies to evaluate the performance of dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) and semiempirical molecular orbital (SMO) methods for the relative energies of [n]helicenes. Nearly all DFT methods perform poorly with root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) above 10 kJ/mol. The best-performing DFT method, BLYP-D4, attains an RMSD = 5.2 kJ/mol. Surprisingly, the advanced SMO methods, XTB and PM7, outperform the DFT methods and result in RMSDs of 3.0 and 3.1 kJ/mol, respectively.",

The main aim is to examine the effectiveness of the low-cost methods, namely, PBEh-3c, r2SCAN-3c, B97-3c, HF-3c, and GFN2-xTB, in reproducing the geometries of these defects basing on the similarity between the results of the subsequent electronic g-tensor calculations. It is revealed that the overall performance of PBEh-3c, r2SCAN-3c, and B97-3c is very alike and can be considered as good, however, none of these “3c” approaches is able to cope with all tested geometries. The results of HF-3c, on the other hand, are disappointing, as this method is outperformed by computationally much more lighter GFN2-xTB. Additional calculations carried out for dangling bonds introduced into hydroxylated and aminated NDs show that all low-cost methods perform reasonably well for this type of defect but the largest quantitative discrepancies once again are demonstrated by HF-3c. The obtained findings lay the foundations for the future studies of larger NDs with the purpose to figure out the magnetic properties dependence on the size of NDs or defect positions within NDs.",

Gas-phase interaction energies are calculated with various composite DFT, semi-empirical quantum mechanical (SQM), and force field (FF) methods and are evaluated using accurate DFT reference values. Of the employed QM methods, PBEh-3c proves to be the most robust for large systems with a relative mean absolute deviation (relMAD) of 8.5% with respect to the reference interaction energies. r<sup>2</sup>SCAN-3c yields an even smaller relMAD, at least for the subset of complexes for which the calculation could be converged, but is less robust for systems with smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps. The inclusion of Fock-exchange is therefore important for the description of very large non-covalent interaction (NCI) complexes in the gas phase. GFN2-xTB was found to be the best performer of the SQM methods with an excellent result of only 11.1% deviation. From the assessed force fields, GFN-FF and GAFF achieve the best accuracy. Considering their low computational costs, both can be recommended for routine calculations of very large NCI complexes, with GFN-FF being clearly superior in terms of general applicability.

            "abstract": "In this work, we develop a new semiempirical method, dubbed NOTCH (Natural Orbital Tied Constructed Hamiltonian). Compared to existing semiempirical methods, NOTCH is less empirical in its functional form as well as parameterization. Specifically, in NOTCH, (1) the core electrons are treated explicitly; (2) the nuclear–nuclear repulsion term is calculated analytically, without any empirical parameterization; (3) the contraction coefficients of the atomic orbital (AO) basis depend on the coordinates of the neighboring atoms, which allows the size of AOs to depend on the molecular environment, despite the fact that a minimal basis set is used; (4) the one-center integrals of free atoms are derived from scalar relativistic multireference equation-of-motion coupled cluster calculations instead of empirical fitting, drastically reducing the number of necessary empirical parameters; (5) the (AA|AB) and (AB|AB)-type two-center integrals are explicitly included, going beyond the neglect of differential diatomic overlap approximation; and (6) the integrals depend on the atomic charges, effectively mimicking the “breathing” of AOs when the atomic charge varies. For this preliminary report, the model has been parameterized for the elements H–Ne, giving only 8 empirical global parameters. Preliminary results on the ionization potentials, electron affinities, and excitation energies of atoms and diatomic molecules, as well as the equilibrium geometries, vibrational frequencies dipole moments, and bond dissociation energies of diatomic molecules, show that the accuracy of NOTCH rivals or exceeds those of popular semiempirical methods (including PM3, PM7, OM2, OM3, GFN-xTB, and GFN2-xTB) as well as the cost-effective ab initio method Hartree–Fock-3c.",

We designed two pharmaceutically beneficial HB databases, database A including ca. 12,000 protein–ligand complexes with ca. 22,000 HBs and their geometries, and database B including ca. 400 protein–ligand complexes with ca. 2200 HBs, their geometries, and bond strengths determined via our local vibrational mode analysis. We identified seven major HB patterns, which can be utilized as a de novo QSAR model to predict the binding affinity for a specific protein–ligand complex. Glycine was reported as the most abundant amino acid residue in both donor and acceptor profiles, and N–H⋯O was the most frequent HB type found in database A. HBs were preferred to be in the linear range, and linear HBs were identified as the strongest. HBs with HB angles in the range of 100–110°, typically forming intramolecular five-membered ring structures, showed good hydrophobic properties and membrane permeability. Utilizing database B, we found a generalized Badger’s relationship for more than 2200 protein–ligand HBs. In addition, the strength and occurrence maps between each amino acid residue and ligand functional groups open an attractive possibility for a novel drug-design approach and for determining drug selectivity and affinity, and they can also serve as an important tool for the hit-to-lead process.",

            "abstract": "This work analyzes the performance of 250 electronic structure theory methods (including 240 density functional approximations) for the description of spin states and the binding properties of iron, manganese, and cobalt porphyrins. The assessment employs the Por21 database of high-level computational data (CASPT2 reference energies taken from the literature). Results show that current approximations fail to achieve the “chemical accuracy” target of 1.0 kcal/mol by a long margin. The best-performing methods achieve a mean unsigned error (MUE) <15.0 kcal/mol, but the errors are at least twice as large for most methods. Semilocal functionals and global hybrid functionals with a low percentage of exact exchange are found to be the least problematic for spin states and binding energies, in agreement with the general knowledge in transition metal computational chemistry. Approximations with high percentages of exact exchange (including range-separated and double-hybrid functionals) can lead to catastrophic failures. More modern approximations usually perform better than older functionals. An accurate statistical analysis of the results also casts doubts on some of the reference energies calculated using multireference methods. Suggestions and general guidelines for users are provided in the conclusions. These results hopefully stimulate advances for both the wave function and the density functional side of electronic structure calculations.",

Herein, we compare the performance of several neglect of diatomic differential overlap-based semiempirical (MNDO/d, AM1, PM6, PM6-D3H4X, PM7, and ODM2), density-functional tight-binding based (DFTB3, DFTB/ChIMES, GFN1-xTB, and GFN2-xTB) models with pure machine learning potentials (ANI-1x and ANI-2x) and hybrid quantum mechanical/machine learning potentials (AIQM1 and QDπ) for a wide range of data computed at a consistent ωB97X/6-31G* level of theory (as in the ANI-1x database). This data includes conformational energies, intermolecular interactions, tautomers, and protonation states. Additional comparisons are made to a set of natural and synthetic nucleic acids from the artificially expanded genetic information system that has important implications for the design of new biotechnology and therapeutics. Finally, we examine the acid/base chemistry relevant for RNA cleavage reactions catalyzed by small nucleolytic ribozymes, DNAzymes, and ribonucleases. Overall, the hybrid quantum mechanical/machine learning potentials appear to be the most robust for these datasets, and the recently developed QDπ model performs exceptionally well, having especially high accuracy for tautomers and protonation states relevant to drug discovery.",

            "abstract": "While short-range noncovalent interactions (NCIs) are proving to be of importance in many chemical and biological systems, these atypical bindings happen within the so-called van der Waals envelope and pose an enormous challenge for current computational methods. We introduce SNCIAA, a database of 723 benchmark interaction energies of short-range noncovalent interactions between neutral/charged amino acids originated from protein x-ray crystal structures at the “gold standard” coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples/complete basis set [CCSD(T)/CBS] level of theory with a mean absolute binding uncertainty less than 0.1 kcal/mol. Subsequently, a systematic assessment of commonly used computational methods, such as the second-order Møller−Plesset theory (MP2), density functional theory (DFT), symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), composite electronic-structure methods, semiempirical approaches, and the physical-based potentials with machine learning (IPML) on SNCIAA is carried out. It is shown that the inclusion of dispersion corrections is essential even though these dimers are dominated by electrostatics, such as hydrogen bondings and salt bridges. Overall, MP2, ωB97M-V, and B3LYP+D4 turned out to be the most reliable methods for the description of short-range NCIs even in strongly attractive/repulsive complexes. SAPT is also recommended in describing short-range NCIs only if the δMP2 correction has been included. The good performance of IPML for dimers at close-equilibrium and long-range conditions is not transferable to the short-range. We expect that SNCIAA will assist the development/improvement/validation of computational methods, such as DFT, force-fields, and ML models, in describing NCIs across entire potential energy surfaces (short-, intermediate-, and long-range NCIs) on the same footing.",

By substitution of functional groups on the quinoline moiety the electron transfer abilities of these complexes can be tuned. In order to explore the full substitution space by simulations, the accurate theoretical description of the effect of functional groups is essential. In this study, we compare three different methods for the theoretical description of the structures. We use the semi-empirical tight-binding method GFN2-xTB, the density functional TPSSh and the double-hybrid functional B2PLYP. We evaluate the methods on five different complex pairs (Cu(I) and Cu(II) complexes), and compare how well calculated energies can predict the redox potentials. We find even though B2PLYP and TPSSh yield better accordance with the experimental structures. GFN2-xTB performs surprisingly well in the geometry optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. TPSSh offers a good compromise between computational cost and accuracy of the redox potential for real-life complexes.",

We investigate the conformational equilibria in several media and the effects that molecules of solvent might have in interconversion barriers between the different conformers. These are studied in a hypothetical gas phase, in the dielectric of a solvent, as well as with hybrid solvation. In the latter case, due to a disruption of π-stacking interactions, the transition states are destabilized. We also evaluate the complexation of the buckycatcher with solvent-like molecules. In most cases studied, there should be no adducts formed because the enthalpy driving force cannot overcome entropic penalties.",

            "abstract": "To improve the performance of the third-order density-functional tight-binding method (DFTB3) for non-covalent interactions involving organic and biological molecules, a chemical-potential equalization (CPE) approach was introduced [J. Phys. Chem. A, 116, 9131 (2012)] and parameterized for the H, C, N, O, and S chemical elements [J. Chem. Phys., 143, 084123 (2015)]. Based largely on equilibrium structures, the parameterized DFTB3/CPE models were shown to exhibit improvements in molecular polarizabilities and intermolecular interactions. With more extensive analyses, however, we observe here that the available DFTB3/CPE models have two critical limitations: (1) they lead to sharply varying potential energy surfaces, thus causing numerical instability in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and (2) they lead to spurious interactions at short distances for some dimer complexes. These shortcomings are attributed to the employed screening functions and the overfitting of CPE parameters. In this work, we introduce a new strategy to simplify the parameterization procedure and significantly reduce free parameters down to four global (i.e., independent of element type) ones. With this strategy, two new models, DFTB3/CPE(r) and DFTB3/CPE(r†) are parameterized. The new models lead to smooth potential energy surfaces, stable MD simulations, and alleviate the spurious interactions at short distances, thus representing consistent improvements for both neutral and ionic hydrogen bonds.",

They are also fundamental for high-quality parameterization of force fields. Traditionally, accurate conformational profiles are obtained with density functional theory (DFT) methods. However, obtaining a reliable energy profile can be time-consuming when the molecular sizes are relatively large or when there are many molecules of interest. Furthermore, incorporation of data-driven deep learning methods into force field development has great requirements for high-quality geometry and energy data. To this end, we compared several possible alternatives to the traditional DFT methods for conformational scans, including the semi-empirical method GFN2-xTB and the neural network potential ANI-2x. It was found that a sequential protocol of geometry optimization with the semi-empirical method and single-point energy calculation with high-level DFT methods can provide satisfactory conformational energy profiles hundreds of times faster in terms of optimization.",

We report the accurate estimation of hydrogen atom transfer barriers using inexpensive descriptors computed for a panel of 21 compounds. By a simple univariate linear regression between barriers previously computed using density functional theory (DFT) and newly computed “frozen radical” bond dissociation energies using the GFN2-xTB method, a mean absolute error of 1 kcal mol−1 is achieved. Other affordable levels of theory are studied to assess differences in performance and computational cost. Multiple linear regression incorporating additional descriptors using GFN2-xTB is shown to predict HAT barriers with mean absolute errors of 0.82 kcal mol−1. With computing times in milliseconds on modest computing hardware, this systematic approach is accessible and extensible to large scale screening workflows.",

However, accurate quantum chemistry calculation is costly for the simulation of large-size soot molecules and high-throughput calculations. Semi-empirical (SE) quantum chemistry methods are optional choices for balancing computational costs. In this work, we validated the performances of several widely used SE methods in the description of soot formation. Our benchmark study focuses on, but is not limited to, the validation of the performances of SE methods on reactive and non-reactive MD trajectory calculations. We also examined the accuracy of SE methods of predicting soot precursor structures and energy profiles along intrinsic reaction coordinate(s) (IRC). Finally, we discussed the spin density predicted by SE methods. The SE methods validated include AM1, PM6, PM7, GFN2-xTB, DFTB2, with or without spin-polarization, and DFTB3. We found that the shape of MD trajectory profiles, the relative energy, and molecular structures predicted by SE methods are qualitatively correct. We suggest that SE methods can be used in massive reaction soot formation event sampling and primary reaction mechanism generation. Yet, they cannot be used to provide quantitatively accurate data, such as thermodynamic and reaction kinetics ones.",

The median Pearson correlation coefficients of ρ = 0.84 (GFN2-xTB) and ρ = 0.82 (GFN1-xTB) do not give the clear preference to any tested approach. GFN1-xTB method demonstrates more stable performance than its GFN2-xTB successor with the average mean absolute errors (MAEs)/mean signed errors (MSEs) of 1.2/0.2 and 2.3/1.6 kcal mol−1, respectively. Conformational energies produced by the computationally efficient DFT functional PBE and double-ζ basis set complemented with –D3(BJ) dispersion correction are suitable for the preliminary sampling (median ρ = 0.93), but should be used with a caution for the calculations of the average ensemble properties (MAE/MSE = 1.7/1.1 kcal mol−1). Higher-ranking PBE0-D3(BJ) and ωB97M-V with triple-ζ basis sets yield significantly lower MAEs/MSEs of 0.55/0.20 and 0.51/0.23 kcal mol−1, respectively.",

We first investigate the accuracy of the additive model used in GFN2, a highly-efficient semi-empirical tight-binding method, and the D4 dispersion model, comparing its predicted additive polarizabilities to ωB97XD results for a subset of PubChemQC and a compiled benchmark set of molecules spanning polarizabilities from approximately 3 Å3 to 600 Å3, with some compounds in the range of approximately 1200–1400 Å3. Although we find additive GFN2 polarizabilities, and thus D4, to have large errors with polarizability calculations on large conjugated oligomers, it would appear an empirical quadratic correction can largely remedy this. We also compare the accuracy of DFT polarizability calculations run using basis sets of varying size and level of augmentation, determining that a non-augmented basis set may be used for large, highly polarizable species in conjunction with a linear correction factor to achieve accuracy extremely close to that of aug-cc-pVTZ.",

All levels of theory yield a similar description of the spherically-shaped first solvation layer found in the range of 6.4 to 6.9 Å. The structural and dynamical data obtained via RI B3LYP-D3 are found in good agreement with the high level RI MP2 reference, whereas the SCC DFTB/3ob and GFN2-xTB methods displayed minor deficiencies in the description of halogen-based interactions. Despite the observed structural differences both the vibrational frequencies of the solute as well as the first shell mean ligand residence times show similar values, pointing towards rapid exchange reactions of first shell ligands with the bulk. In addition several classical potential models for the description of the system have been assessed and adjusted MM potential parameters providing structural and dynamical data comparable to the much more expensive quantum chemical methods are provided.",

Contemporary composite density functional theory (DFT) (PBEh-3c and B97-3c), semiempirical (PM6 and PM7) and the GFNn-xTB/FF family methods were examined against conventional DFT (PBE-D3(BJ), PBE0-D3(BJ), M06 and ωB97X-V) to reproduce the conformational energies. While good performance is observed for the conventional (the average Pearson correlation coefficient is ρ = 0.91) and composite DFT (average ρ = 0.93), semiempirical and force-field methods should still be used with caution for these challenging compounds. The corresponding average ρ values are 0.53 (PM6 and PM7), 0.75 (GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB) and 0.62 (GFN-FF). Accounting for the intramolecular dispersion interactions turned out to be crucial for 4 OSTM complexes bearing bulky substituents in close proximity to each other. The influence of the scalar relativistic effects on the conformational energies is negligible for the considered 3d metal species.",

            "abstract": "Protein–ligand interactions are crucial in many biochemical processes and biomedical applications, yet accurately calculating the binding free energy of the interactions still remains challenging. In this work, we systematically investigate the performance of a generic force field GFN-FF and some semi-empirical quantum mechanical (SQM) methods (GFNn, n = 0, 1, 2) in terms of the accuracy of the calculated binding free energy. It is found that the performance of the GFN-FF method is quite good in a neutral-ligand system since the Pearson correlation coefficient (rp) is 0.70 and the mean absolute error (MAE) is 5.49 kcal mol−1. However, it may fail in a charged-ligand system (the MAE is 18.98 kcal mol−1). Moreover, we also propose a cluster model (i.e., truncating the protein at a given cutoff) along with the SQM method in the GFN family. Importantly, the GFN2-xTB shows the best performance among the SQM methods (the MAE is 4.91 kcal mol−1 and 10.25 kcal mol−1 in the neutral-ligand and charged-ligand systems, respectively), much better than GFN-FF in the charged-ligand system. Notably, the computing cost of the GFN2-xTB in the appropriate cluster model is even lower than that of the GFN-FF (in the entire complex). The present study sheds some light on the potential power of the GFN family in the efficient calculation of the binding free energy in bio-systems.",

            "abstract": "The corannulene pincer (also known in the literature as the buckycatcher) is a fascinating system that may encapsulate, among other molecules, the C60 and C70 fullerenes. These complexes are held together by strong π-stacking interactions. Although these are quantum mechanical effects, their description by quantum chemical methods has proved very hard. We used three semi-empirical methods, PM6-D3H4X, PM6-D3H+ and GFN2-xTB, to model the interactions. Binding to fullerenes was extended to all open conformations of the buckycatcher, and with the proper choice of solvation model and partition functions, we obtained Gibbs free energies of binding that deviated by 1.0–1.5 kcal/mol from the experimental data. Adding three-body dispersion to PM6-D3H+ led to even better agreement. These results agree better with the experimental data than calculations using higher-level methods at a significantly lower fraction of the computational cost. Furthermore, the formation of adducts with C60 was studied using dynamical simulations, which helped to build a more complete picture of the behavior of the corannulene pincer with fullerenes. We also investigated the use of exchange-binding models to recover more information on this system in solution. Though the final Gibbs free energies in solution were worsened, gas-phase enthalpies and entropies better mirrored the experimental data.",

For non-rigid molecules, a substantial part of the entropy can be attributed to a conformational contribution. Systems and properties where this is relevant, e.g., protein–ligand binding affinities or pKa values refer usually to the liquid phase. In this work, the influence of solvation on the conformational entropy is investigated. A recently introduced state-of-the-art and automated computational protocol for the computation of conformational entropies [Pracht et al., Chem. Sci., 2021, 12, 6551–6568.] is applied in combination with fast and accurate semiempirical quantum-chemical methods and implicit solvation models for a set of 25 commercially available drug molecules and five transition metal compounds. Computed gas-phase conformational entropies are compared with values obtained in implicit n-hexane and water. It is found that implicit solvation can have a substantial effect of several cal mol−1 K−1 on the entropy as a result of large conformational changes in the different phases. We conclude that for flexible molecules chemical accuracy for free energies in solution can only be achieved if solvation effects on the conformational ensemble are considered.",

The resulting parameter sets have been compared to newly calculated reference data obtained via resolution-of-identity 2nd order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory. The data collected in this work suggests that the optimized values in this study provide a more suitable setup of the QM/MM link bonds compared to the use of a single global setting applied to every amino acid fragmented by the QM/MM interface. The results also imply that a transfer of the ideal link bond settings between different levels of theory is not advised. In contrast, virtually identical parameters were obtained in calculations employing different variants of the AMBER force field. Considering the increasing success of tight binding based approaches being inter alia a results of their exceptional accuracy/effort ratio the provided collection of link atoms parameters provides a valuable resource for QM/MM studies of biomacromolecular systems as demonstrated in an exemplary QM/MM MD simulation of the β-amyloid/Zn2+ complex.",

The synthesis method and its reaction condition for coordinating the first-row transition complex compound with base Schiff’s ligands SDPH (Salicylaldehyde-2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine) and VDPH (Vanillin-Dinitrophenylhydrazine) were still challenging to be applied as not all reaction conditions can succeed in the synthesis experiment. To determine the potential of first-row transition metal ions coordinating with SDPH and VDPH ligands, this research studies computationally the Extended Tight Binding Quantum Chemical method, called GFN2-xTB. Variations of the octahedral complex molecular formula used in computational calculations are [M(L)2XaYb] and [M(L)2XaYb]+ with M = (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni); L = SDPH and VDPH; X = NH3 (a = 0 or 1); and Y = H2O (b = 1 or 2). In addition, these complex compounds, which have metal ions with electron configuration d4-d7, were studied for their stability under high and low spin conditions. The data indicate the presence of stable complexes with more negative ∆G values were generally found in: (i) complexes with VDPH ligands, (ii) complexes containing the NH3 ligand, (iii) complexes with metal ions M+3, (iv) complexes having low spin magnetic properties. These results were also supported by the characteristics of global reactive descriptors, including a global electrophilicity index, electronegativity, chemical potential, chemical hardness, and chemical softness. It also included studies related to the HOMO-LUMO electronic energy to determine the reactivity and stability of the studied complex compounds.",

(2021). Acta Cryst. E77, 298–304]. The asymmetric unit of the title compound includes two structurally independent complex anions [Ni(C7H6N4O7)]2−, which exhibit an L-shaped geometry and consist of two almost flat fragments perpendicular to one another: the 1,3,5-oxadiazinane fragment and the fragment including other atoms of the anion. The central Ni atom is in a square-planar N2O2 coordination arrangement formed by two amide N and two carboxyl­ate O atoms. In the crystal, the title compound forms a layered structure in which layers of negatively charged complex anions and positively charged potassium cations are stacked along the a-axis direction. The polymeric framework is stabilized by a system of hydrogen-bonding inter­actions in which the water mol­ecules act as donors and the carb­oxy­lic, amide and water O atoms act as acceptors.",

We use semiempirical tight-binding methods to construct a dataset of nearly 34 000 molecules and train graph convolutional networks to predict energy densities, kinetic stability, and absorption spectra and then use the models together with a genetic algorithm to search the chemical space for promising MOST energy storage systems. We identify 15 kinetically stable molecules, five of which have energy densities greater than 0.45 MJ/kg, and the main conclusion of this study is that the largest energy density that can be obtained for a single norbornadiene moiety with the substituents considered here, while maintaining a long half-life and absorption in the visible spectrum, is around 0.55 MJ/kg.",

            "abstract": "The strongly attractive noncovalent interactions of charged atoms or molecules with π-systems are important binding motifs in many chemical and biological systems. These so-called ion–π interactions play a major role in enzymes, molecular recognition, and for the structure of proteins. In this work, a molecular test set termed IONPI19 is compiled for inter- and intramolecular ion–π interactions, which is well balanced between anionic and cationic systems. The IONPI19 set includes interaction energies of significantly larger molecules (up to 133 atoms) than in other ion–π test sets and covers a broad range of binding motifs. Accurate (local) coupled cluster values are provided as reference. Overall, 19 density functional approximations, including seven (meta-)GGAs, eight hybrid functionals, and four double-hybrid functionals combined with three different London dispersion corrections, are benchmarked for interaction energies. DFT results are further compared to wave function based methods such as MP2 and dispersion corrected Hartree–Fock. Also, the performance of semiempirical QM methods such as the GFNn-xTB and PMx family of methods is tested. It is shown that dispersion-uncorrected DFT underestimates ion–π interactions significantly, even though electrostatic interactions dominate the overall binding. Accordingly, the new charge dependent D4 dispersion model is found to be consistently better than the standard D3 correction. Furthermore, the functional performance trend along Jacob's ladder is generally obeyed and the reduction of the self-interaction error leads to an improvement of (double) hybrid functionals over (meta-)GGAs, even though the effect of the SIE is smaller than expected. Overall, the double-hybrids PWPB95-D4/QZ and revDSD-PBEP86-D4/QZ turned out to be the most reliable among all assessed methods for the description of ion–π interactions, which opens up new perspectives for systems where coupled cluster calculations are no longer computationally feasible.",

Here, we demonstrate that four-dimensional chirality arising from antisymmetry of alchemical perturbations dissects CCS and defines approximate ranks, which reduce its formal dimensionality and break down its combinatorial scaling. The resulting “alchemical” enantiomers have the same electronic energy up to the third order, independent of respective covalent bond topology, imposing relevant constraints on chemical bonding. Alchemical chirality deepens our understanding of CCS and enables the establishment of trends without empiricism for any materials with fixed lattices. We demonstrate the efficacy for three cases: (i) new rules for electronic energy contributions to chemical bonding; (ii) analysis of the electron density of BN-doped benzene; and (iii) ranking over 2000 and 4 million BN-doped naphthalene and picene derivatives, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Performance of computational methods in modelling cyclic dinucleotides – an important and challenging class of compounds – has been evaluated by two different benchmarks: (1) gas-phase conformational energies and (2) qualitative agreement with NMR observations of the orientation of the χ-dihedral angle in solvent. In gas-phase benchmarks, where CCSD(T) and DLPNO-CCSD(T) methods have been used as the reference, most of the (dispersion corrected) density functional approximations are accurate enough to justify prioritizing computational cost and compatibility with other modelling options as the criterion of choice. NMR experiments of 3′3′-c-di-AMP, 3′3′-c-GAMP, and 3′3′-c-di-GMP show the overall prevalence of the anti-conformation of purine bases, but some population of syn-conformations is observed for guanines. Implicit solvation models combined with quantum-chemical methods struggle to reproduce this behaviour, probably due to a lack of dynamics and explicitly modelled solvent, leading to structures that are too compact. Molecular dynamics simulations overrepresent the syn-conformation of guanine due to the overestimation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. Our combination of experimental and computational benchmarks provides “error bars” for modelling cyclic dinucleotides in solvent, where such information is generally difficult to obtain, and should help gauge the interpretability of studies dealing with binding of cyclic dinucleotides to important pharmaceutical targets. At the same time, the presented analysis calls for improvement in both implicit solvation models and force-field parameters.",

            "abstract": "Conformational energies are an important chemical property for which a performance assessment of theoretical methods is mandatory. Existing benchmark sets are often limited to biochemical or main group element containing molecules, while organometallic systems are generally less studied. A key problem herein is to routinely generate conformers for these molecules due to their complexity and manifold of possible coordination patterns. In this study we used our recently published CREST protocol [Pracht et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2020, 22, 7169–7192] to generate conformer ensembles for a variety of 40 challenging transition metal containing molecules, which were then used to form a comprehensive conformational energy benchmark set termed TMCONF40. Several low-cost semiempirical, density functional theory (DFT) and force-field methods were compared to high level DLPNO-CCSD(T1) and double-hybrid DFT reference values. Close attention was paid to the energetic ordering of the conformers in the statistical evaluation. With respect to the double-hybrid references, both tested low-cost composite DFT methods produce high Pearson correlation coefficients of rp,mean,B97-3c//B97-3c = 0.922 and rp,mean,PBEh-3c//B97-3c = 0.890, with mean absolute deviations close to or below 1 kcal mol−1. This good performance also holds for a comparison to DLPNO-CCSD(T1) reference energies for a smaller subset termed TMCONF5. Based on DFT geometries, the GFNn-xTB methods yield reasonable Pearson correlation coefficients of rp,mean,GFN1-xTB//B97-3c = 0.617 (MADmean = 2.15 kcal mol−1) and rp,mean,GFN2-xTB//B97-3c = 0.567 (MADmean = 2.68 kcal mol−1), outperforming the widely used PMx methods on the TMCONF40 test set. Employing the low-cost composite DFT method B97-3c on GFN2-xTB geometries yields an slightly improved correlation of rp,mean,B97-3c//GFN2-xTB = 0.632. Furthermore, for 68% of the investigated complexes at least one low-energy conformer was found that is more stable than the respective crystal structure conformation, which signals the importance of conformational studies. General recommendations for the application of the CREST protocol and DFT methods for transition metal conformational energies are given.",

Accordingly, the development and thorough evaluation of fast semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods that are universally applicable to a large part of the periodic table is indispensable. Herein, we report on the capability of the recently developed GFNn-xTB method family for full quantum-mechanical geometry optimisation of medium to very large transition-metal complexes and organometallic supramolecular structures. The results for a specially compiled benchmark set of 145 diverse closed-shell transition-metal complex structures for all metals up to Hg are presented. Further the GFNn-xTB methods are tested on three established benchmark sets regarding reaction energies and barrier heights of organometallic reactions.",

However, in recent years, the targets of spectroscopic studies are shifting toward flexible molecules, characterized by a large number of closely spaced energy minima, all contributing to the overall spectrum. Here, artificial intelligence comes into play since it is at the basis of powerful unsupervised techniques for the exploration of soft degrees of freedom. Integration of such algorithms with a two-stage QM/QM′ (Quantum Mechanical) exploration/refinement strategy driven by a user-friendly graphical interface is the topic of the present paper. We will address in particular: (i) the performances of different semi-empirical methods for the exploration step and (ii) the comparison between stochastic and meta-heuristic algorithms in achieving a cheap yet complete exploration of the conformational space for medium sized chromophores. As test cases, we choose three amino acids of increasing complexity, whose full conformer enumeration has been reached only very recently. Next, we show that systems in condensed phases can be treated at the same level and with the same efficiency when employing a polarizable continuum description of the solvent. Finally, the challenging issue represented by the vibrational circular dichroism spectra of some rhodium complexes with flexible ligands has been addressed, showing that our fully unsupervised approach leads to remarkable agreement with the experiment.",

First-principles calculations coupled with the quasi-harmonic approximation for crystals and with the conformation mixing model for the ideal gas are used to explain this phenomenon from the theoretical point of view. Crystals of the odd and even alkane-α,ω-diamines distinctly differ in their packing motifs. However, first-principles calculations indicate that it is a delicate interplay of the cohesive forces, phonons, molecular vibrations and conformational equilibrium which governs the odd-even pattern of the sublimation enthalpies within the homologous series. High molecular flexibility of the alkane-α,ω-diamines predetermines higher sensitivity of the computational model to the quality of the optimized geometries and relative conformational energies. Performance of high-throughput computational methods, such as the density functional tight binding (DFTB, GFN2-xTB) and the explicitly correlated dispersion-corrected Møller-Plesset perturbative method (MP2C-F12), are benchmarked against the consistent state-of-the-art calculations of conformational energies and interaction energies, respectively.",

Conventional molecular dynamics simulation of Cu-GHK shows the stability of the copper-peptide binding over 100 ps trajectory. Four equatorial bonds in 3N1O coordination remain stable throughout simulation, while a fifth in apical position from C-terminal carboxylate is more fluxional. We also show that the automated conformer and rotamer search algorithm CREST is able to correctly predict the metal binding position from a starting point consisting of separated peptide, copper and water.",

The study of these iCOMs formation and their binding energy to the ASW, using computational chemistry, depends strongly on the ASW models used, as different models may exhibit sites with different adsorbing features. ASW extended models are rare in the literature because large sizes require very large computational resources when quantum mechanical methods based on DFT are used. To circumvent this problem, we propose to use the newly developed GFN-xTB Semi-empirical Quantum Mechanical (SQM) methods from the Grimme’s group. These methods are, at least, two orders of magnitude faster than conventional DFT, only require modest central memory, and in this paper we aim to benchmark their accuracy against rigorous and resource hungry quantum mechanical methods. We focused on 38 water structures studied by MP2 and CCSD(T) approaches comparing energetic and structures with three levels of GFN-xTB parametrization (GFN0, GFN1, GFN2) methods. The extremely good results obtained at the very cheap GFN-xTB level for both water cluster structures and energetic paved the way towards the modeling of very large AWS models of astrochemical interest.",

            "abstract": "We present the first benchmark set focusing on the conformational energies of highly flexible, long n-alkane chains, termed ACONFL. Unbranched alkanes are ubiquitous building blocks in nature, so the goal is to be able to calculate their properties most accurately to improve the modeling of, e.g., complex (biological) systems. Very accurate DLPNO–CCSD(T1)/CBS reference values are provided, which allow for a statistical meaningful evaluation of even the best available density functional methods. The performance of established and modern (dispersion corrected) density functionals is comprehensively assessed. The recently introduced r2SCAN-V functional shows excellent performance, similar to efficient composite DFT methods like B97-3c and r2SCAN-3c, which provide an even better cost-accuracy ratio, while almost reaching the accuracy of much more computationally demanding hybrid or double hybrid functionals with large QZ AO basis sets. In addition, we investigated the performance of common wave function methods, where MP2/CBS surprisingly performs worse compared to the simple D4 dispersion corrected Hartree–Fock. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of several semiempirical and force field methods, which are commonly used for the generation of conformational ensembles in multilevel workflows or in large scale molecular dynamics studies. Outstanding performance is obtained by the recently introduced general force field, GFN-FF, while other commonly applied methods like the universal force field yield large errors. We recommend the ACONFL as a helpful benchmark set for parametrization of new semiempirical or force field methods and machine learning potentials as well as a meaningful validation set for newly developed DFT or dispersion methods.",

The full density functional theory PBE-dDsC functional (within the plane-wave formalism) was employed to benchmark the semiempirical tight-binding DFTB and GFNn-xTB (n = 0, 1, 2) and the reactive force-field ReaxFF. Performances were evaluated by comparing several size-dependent features (such as relative stabilities, structural descriptors, and vibrational features) computed with the different methods. Various structures (ordered and amorphous) and sizes (from Pt13 to Pt561) were considered in the datasets. ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) was employed to achieve the amorphization of cuboctahedral Pt147, Pt309, and Pt561 geometries, which were subsequently optimized with both the low-cost methods and the DFT reference, within a multilevel modeling approach. The structures were further annealed with GFN0-xTB MD. While DFTB performs quite well over all the selected structures, GFN2-xTB and the cheaper GFN0-xTB show a general predilection for amorphous geometries. The performances of GFN2-xTB are found to worsen with the increasing size of the system, while ReaxFF and GFN0-xTB undergo the opposite trend. We suggest that the semiempirical DFTB (and within certain limitations GFN0-xTB and ReaxFF) could be suited for fast screening through amorphous big-sized Pt NPs.",

            "abstract": "Quantum chemistry provides chemists with invaluable information, but the high computational cost limits the size and type of systems that can be studied. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a means to dramatically lower the cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, ML models often sacrifice interpretability by using components such as the artificial neural networks of deep learning that function as black boxes. These components impart the flexibility needed to learn from large volumes of data but make it difficult to gain insight into the physical or chemical basis for the predictions. Here, we demonstrate that semiempirical quantum chemical (SEQC) models can learn from large volumes of data without sacrificing interpretability. The SEQC model is that of density-functional-based tight binding (DFTB) with fixed atomic orbital energies and interactions that are one-dimensional functions of the interatomic distance. This model is trained to ab initio data in a manner that is analogous to that used to train deep learning models. Using benchmarks that reflect the accuracy of the training data, we show that the resulting model maintains a physically reasonable functional form while achieving an accuracy, relative to coupled cluster energies with a complete basis set extrapolation (CCSD(T)*/CBS), that is comparable to that of density functional theory (DFT). This suggests that trained SEQC models can achieve a low computational cost and high accuracy without sacrificing interpretability. Use of a physically motivated model form also substantially reduces the amount of ab initio data needed to train the model compared to that required for deep learning models.",

Cluster formation is usually studied using quantum chemical methods, which quickly becomes computationally expensive when system sizes grow. In this work, we present a large database of ∼250k atmospheric relevant cluster structures, which can be applied for developing machine learning (ML) models. The database is used to train the ML model kernel ridge regression (KRR) with the FCHL19 representation. We test the ability of the model to extrapolate from smaller clusters to larger clusters, between different molecules, between equilibrium structures and out-of-equilibrium structures, and the transferability onto systems with new interactions. We show that KRR models can extrapolate to larger sizes and transfer acid and base interactions with mean absolute errors below 1 kcal/mol. We suggest introducing an iterative ML step in configurational sampling processes, which can reduce the computational expense. Such an approach would allow us to study significantly more cluster systems at higher accuracy than previously possible and thereby allow us to cover a much larger part of relevant atmospheric compounds.",

The data set contains 67 crystals consisting of mostly rigid molecules with a single dominant conformer, covering the majority of known structural types. The experimental crystal structure is available for the entire data set, whereas zero-temperature unit cell volume can be reliably estimated for a subset of 28 crystals. Using this subset, we benchmark r2SCAN-D3 and PBE-D3 density functionals. Then, for the entire data set, we benchmark approximate density functional theory (DFT) methods, including GFN1-xTB and DFTB3(3ob-3-1), with various dispersion corrections against r2SCAN-D3. Our results show that r2SCAN-D3 geometries are accurate within a few percent, which is comparable to the statistical uncertainty of experimental data at a fixed temperature, but the unit cell volume is systematically underestimated by 2% on average. The several times faster PBE-D3 provides an unbiased estimate of the volume for all systems except for molecules with highly polar bonds, for which the volume is substantially overestimated in correlation with the underestimation of atomic charges. Considered approximate DFT methods are orders of magnitude faster and provide qualitatively correct but overcompressed crystal structures unless the dispersion corrections are fitted by unit cell volume.",

Many conformer sampling methods derive torsional angle distributions from experimental crystallographic data, limiting the torsion preferences to molecules that must be stable, synthetically accessible, and able to be crystallized. In this work, we evaluate the differences in torsional preferences of experimental crystallographic geometries and gas-phase computed conformers from a broad selection of compounds to determine whether torsional angle distributions obtained from semiempirical methods are suitable priors for conformer sampling. We find that differences in torsion preferences can be mostly attributed to a lack of available experimental crystallographic data with small deviations derived from gas-phase geometry differences. GFN2 demonstrates the ability to provide accurate and reliable torsional preferences that can provide a basis for new methods free from the limitations of experimental data collection. We provide Gaussian-based fits and sampling distributions suitable for torsion sampling and propose an alternative to the widely used “experimental torsion and knowledge distance geometry” (ETKDG) method using quantum torsion-derived distance geometry (QTDG) methods.",

Including an accurate description of radical species extends the scope of possible applications to bond dissociation energy (BDE) prediction, for example, in the context of cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism. The transferability of the MACE potential was validated on the COMP6 data set, containing only closed-shell molecules, where it reaches better accuracy than the readily available general ANI-2x potential. MACE achieves similar accuracy on two CYP metabolism-specific data sets, which include open- and closed-shell structures. This model enables us to calculate the aliphatic C–H BDE, which allows us to compare reaction energies of hydrogen abstraction, which is the rate-limiting step of the aliphatic hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by CYPs. On the “CYP 3A4” data set, MACE achieves a BDE RMSE of 1.37 kcal/mol and better prediction of BDE ranks than alternatives: the semiempirical AM1 and GFN2-xTB methods and the ALFABET model that directly predicts bond dissociation enthalpies. Finally, we highlight the smoothness of the MACE potential over paths of sp3C–H bond elongation and show that a minimal extension is enough for the MACE model to start finding reasonable minimum energy paths of methoxy radical-mediated hydrogen abstraction. Altogether, this work lays the ground for further extensions of scope in terms of chemical elements, (CYP-mediated) reaction classes and modeling the full reaction paths, not only BDEs.",
