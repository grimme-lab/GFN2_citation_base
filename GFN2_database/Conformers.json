            "abstract": "Radiolytic stability is one of the main requirements of the ligands for the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The prediction of radiation stability based only on the 2D molecular structural formula allows us to accelerate and simplify the development of new ligands. Here, we used quantum chemistry to investigate the radiolytic behavior of water-soluble diglycolamides as one of the most popular ligands for spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. The accurate accounting of conformational mobility in the descriptors based on the Frontier Orbital Fukui theory allowed us to obtain a good correlation between theoretical and experimental data.",

The desulfurization effect by ZIF-8/[THTDP][BTI] combined both the adsorptive desulfurization by ZIF-8 and the extraction desulfurization by [THTDP][BTI]. The removal of the three chosen aromatic organic sulfides by the ZIF-8/[THTDP][BTI] porous liquid followed the order of dibenzothiophene (73.1%) > benzothiophene (70.0%) > thiophene (61.5%). It was further found that deep desulfurization could be realized by ZIF-8/[THTDP][BTI] through triple desulfurization cycles and ZIF-8/[THTDP][BTI] can be regenerated readily. The desulfurization mechanism was explored further in detail by conformation search and density functional theory calculations. Calculations supported that the large molecular volume of [THTDP][BTI] excluded itself from the cavities of ZIF-8, making the pores of ZIF-8 in the porous liquid unoccupied and accessible by other guest species, here the studied organic sulfides. These calculations indicate that the van der Waals interactions were the main interactions between ZIF-8/[THTDP][BTI] and specifically benzothiophene. This work supports that the porous liquid ZIF-8/[THTDP][BTI] could potentially be used for desulfurization of diesel in industry.",

            "abstract": "In this work, sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathodes with atomically dispersed Co and Se active site, namely cobalt selenide doped-sulfide polyacrylonitrile (CoSe2-x@SPAN, x = 6, 10, 15) with different CoSe2 doping concentrations of 6, 10, and 15 wt%, were fabricated by co-heating approach to strengthen the charge conductivity and catalytic activity of SPAN cathode. Atomic scale CoSe2 were doped into the SPAN skeleton to expediating the redox kinetics of lithium storage process, and the catalytic mechanism was made clear by a viewing angle of frontier molecular orbital theory. The DFT calculation results show that CoSe2@SPAN has a more uniform electrostatic potential distribution with a smaller LUMO-HOMO band gap, which is more conducive to electron transport. The Co/Se loaded SPAN polymer constructed by N-Co-S chemical coordination improves the matching degree between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the nucleophile S2− and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electrophile Li+ during the discharge process, and effectively reduces the bonding orbital σ level of the deposited product Li2S, thereby promoting the lithium storage kinetics of CoSe2@SPAN cathode material and avoiding the shuttle effect. Meanwhile, the larger Gibbs free energy variation during the lithiation process indicates the enhanced reaction kinetics of the CoSe2@SPAN cathode. Ultimately, The Li-SPAN battery with CoSe2-10@SPAN cathode delivers high reversible capacity of 1475 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A/g, superior rate capability and long-term capacity retention of 71.1% after 500 cycles at 1.0 A/g. Accordingly, this study offers insights into the utilization of frontier molecular orbital theory (FMO) to improve the redox kinetics and sulfur utilization of Li-SPAN batteries.",

Core-shell Fe3O4@SiO2@TiO2(FST) was prepared and modified with ZnIn2S4 and zinc-tetra(N-carbonylacrylic)aminephthalocyanine (ZnPc) to obtain FSTZP and characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, HRTEM and UV–vis DRS. In FSTZP, ZnIn2S4 could provide more adsorption active sites and promote charge-carrier separation; ZnPc would efficiently use visible light to transfer energy. Both of ZnIn2S4 and ZnPc in FSTZP could improve the light-harvesting resulting in excellent photocatalytic performance of FSTZP towards Cr(VI) reduction and pollutant degradation. The highest reduction efficiency of Cr(VI) by FSTZP(0.3 g/L) was up to 96.4% in 60 min at pH = 6. The removal efficiencies of Rhodamine B (RhB), Methylene blue (MB), Methyl Orange(MO) and Tetracycline hydrochloride(TC•HCl) by FSTZP(0.3 g/L) under visible light were 99%, 99%, 95% and 86% in 40 min at pH = 6. Meanwhile, almost all of Cr(VI) and organic molecules in the coexistence system could be removed by FSTZP under visible light. FSTZP also presented the adsorption property and the mechanism of dual-responsive FSTZP for Cr(VI) reduction and organic pollutants removal was explored. Moreover, as an efficient photocatalyst, FSTZP still maintained stability after reused for fourth photocatalytic cycle by magnetic recovery. This study was devoted to develop an efficient photocatalyst suitable for removing Cr(VI) and organic pollutants.",

Unlike structurally analogous porous organic cages, its synthesis proved challenging due to competitive aminal formation, rationalised using control experiments and computational modelling. The use of an additional amine was found to increase conversion to the desired cage.",

While the absolute configurations of 1a/1b, 2a/2b, 4, 6a/6b, 7, 11a/11b and 15a/15b−18a/18b were established by calculations of electronic circular dichroism data, that of 14 was determined by modified Mosher's method. Compounds 1a/1b and 2a/2b represent a previously unreported type of monoterpenoid dimers via an amide linkage, and compound 3 is a monoterpene-phenylpropanoid hybrid connected through an ester bond. Among the known molecules, the formerly mis-assigned structures of 15a/15b and 22 were revised, and pure natural enantiomers of 16a/16b−18a/18b were reported for the first time. Selective compounds showed antiradical and NO production inhibitory activities in the preliminary biological screening. Compound 31 was further demonstrated to alleviate oxidative stress by activating Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

Kinetic study indicated that the most potent compound 12 was a mixed type inhibitor for α-glucosidase. Molecular docking simulation revealed the interactions of 12 with α-glucosidase. Additionally, Compounds 3 and 6 inhibited glucagon-induced hepatic glucose production in HepG2 cells with EC50 values of 42.0 and 85.9 μM, respectively.

Chain transfer becomes more active in copolymerization than homopolymerization due to an incorporation between low propagation reactivity of alkyl radical and high chain transfer reactivity of VAc. Competition between combination and disproportionation were detailed for self-termination and cross-termination, and most radical chains terminate through combination. Combination involving alkyl radical or tail radical shows much lower energy barrier than combination involving head radical. Effect of head-to-head defect on termination and chain transfer is also clarified. Chain transfer to initiators and termination of primary radicals were studied for BPO and AIBN. The both, especially AIBN, shows reactivity in direct addition of radicals to initiators, which is revealed by this work at first time. Based on kinetics from DFT, a microkinetic simulation was conducted to extend the research from electron scale to micro scale. Relationship between copolymerization conditions (including temperature, monomer composition and concentration, and initiator concentration) and rates of elemental reactions, radical concentrations, DP and PDI was discussed.",

            "abstract": "With the acceleration of the commercialization of degradable polymers, their poor mechanical properties continuously limit their applications. It is important to find a balance between the degradable properties and mechanical properties. Herein, poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) modified by SPG from 10% to 40 mol% were synthesized through a two-step polycondensation. Chemical structures, thermal properties, mechanical properties, viscoelastic behavior and degradation of poly(butylene terephthalate-co-spirocyclic terephthalate) (PBST) were investigated. The SPG could toughen the copolyesters and the elongation at break of PBST20 was up to 260%. Moreover, the introduction of SPG enables to hold an acid-triggered unit in the main chain. PBSTs copolymers maintain stable structures in a neutral environment, and the degradation under acid conditions will be unlocked. As tailoring the content of SPG, the degradable rate of the chain scission in response to acid stimuli will be adjusted. The acid degradation was proved to be occurred at the SPG units in the amorphous phase by DSC, XRD, GPC and  1  H NMR tests. After the acid degradation, the hydrolysis rate will also be accelerated, adapting to the requirements of different degradation schedules. The plausible hydrolytic pathways and mechanisms were proposed based on Fukui function analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.",

The utilization of graphdiyne in gas adsorption and separation has been predicted by computer simulation with many examples. In this work, the triangular basic unit of graphdiyne was introduced into a triptycene-based porous organic polymer to obtain a three dimensional graphdiyne-like porous triptycene network named G-PTN. With high surface area and a microporous structure, G-PTN exhibited convincing application potential for the storage of gas molecules, especially for the selective adsorption of acetylene over ethylene. Computational simulation proved the importance of the triptycene units and three dimensional structure to the selectivity, as well as the potential of graphdiyne units as selective binding sites, suggesting that through judicious design, new three-dimensional porous graphdiyne could be acquired with better gas adsorption and separation performance.",

The supramolecular radical anion (NDI-2CB[7])⋅−, which is obtained from the E. coli-induced in situ reduction of NDI-2CB[7] neutral complex, formed by the host–guest interaction between an NDI derivative and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), exhibits unexpectedly strong NIR-II absorption and remarkable photothermal conversion capacity in aqueous solution. The NIR-II absorption is caused by the self-assembly of NDI radical anions to form supramolecular dimer radicals in aqueous solution, which is supported by theoretically predicted spectra. The (NDI-2CB[7])⋅− demonstrates excellent NIR-II photothermal antimicrobial activity (>99 %). This work provides a new approach for constructing NIR-II photothermal agents and non-contact treatments for bacterial infections.",

We demonstrate that stapling and multicyclisation occurs with a range of non-protected peptides under peptide-compatible conditions, exhibiting chemoselectivity and wide-applicability. Peptides containing two cysteine residues are readily stapled, and the remaining perfluoroaryl groups permit the introduction of a second peptide in a modular fashion to access bicyclic peptides. Similarly, peptides with more than two cysteine residues can afford multicyclic products containing up to three peptide ‘loops’. Finally, we demonstrate that a porphyrin-templated stapled peptide containing the Skin Penetrating and Cell Entering (SPACE) peptide affords a skin cell penetrating conjugate with intrinsic fluorescence.",

However, commercial carbonate electrolytes can scarcely be employed in LMBs owing to their poor compatibility with metallic lithium. N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA)—a crosslinkable solubilizer with a high Gutmann donor number—is employed to facilitate the dissolution of insoluble lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate-based electrolytes and to form gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) through in situ polymerization. The Li+ solvation structure of the GPEs is regulated using LiNO3 and DMAA, which suppresses the decomposition of LiPF6 and facilitates the formation of an inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interface. Consequently, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of the Li||Cu cell assembled with a GPE increases to 98.5% at room temperature, and the high-voltage Li||NCM622 cell achieves a capacity retention of 80.1% with a high CE of 99.5% after 400 cycles. The bifunctional polymer electrolytes are anticipated to pave the way for next-generation high-voltage LMBs.",

            "abstract": "Collinolactone A is a microbial specialized metabolite with a unique 6-10-7 tricyclic bislactone skeleton which was isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. The unusual cyclodecatriene motif features dynamic interconversions of two rotamers. Given the biological profiling of collinolactone A as neuroprotective agent, semisynthetic modifications represent an invaluable strategy to enhance its efficacy. Since understanding conformations and reactions of bioactive substances is crucial for rational structure-based design and synthesis of derivatives, we conducted computational studies on conformational behavior as well as experiments on thermal and acid induced rearrangements of the cyclodecatriene. Experimental conformer ratios of collinolactone A and its biosynthetic ketolactone precursor are well reproduced by computations at the PW6B95-D3/def2-QZVPP//r2SCAN-3c level. Upon heating collinolactone A in anhydrous dioxane at 100 °C, three collinolactone B stereoisomers exhibiting enollactone structures form via Cope rearrangements. Our computations predict the energetic preference for a boat-like transition state in agreement with the stereochemical outcome of the main reaction pathway. Constriction of the ten-membered ring forms collinolactone C with four annulated rings and an exocyclic double bond. Computations and semisynthetic experiments demonstrate strong preference for an acid-catalyzed reaction pathway over an alternative Alder-ene route to collinolactone C with a prohibitive reaction barrier, again in line with stereochemical observations.",

            "abstract": "The synthesis of two series of N-annulated perylene bisimides (PBIs), compounds 1 and 2, is reported, and their self-assembling features are thoroughly investigated by a complete set of spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations. The study corroborates the enormous influence that the distance between the PBI core and the peripheral groups exerts on the chiroptical properties and the supramolecular polymerization mechanism. Compounds 1, with the peripheral groups separated from the central PBI core by two methylenes and an ester group, form J-type supramolecular polymers in a cooperative manner but exhibit negligible chiroptical properties. The lack of clear helicity, due to the staircase arrangement of the self-assembling units in the aggregate, justifies these features. In contrast, attaching the peripheral groups directly to the N-annulated PBI core drastically changes the self-assembling properties of compounds 2, which form H-type aggregates following an isodesmic mechanism. These H-type aggregates show a strong aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect that leads to nonemissive aggregates. Chiral (S)-2 and (R)-2 experience an efficient transfer of asymmetry to afford P- and M-type aggregates, respectively, although no amplification of asymmetry is achieved in majority rules or “sergeants-and-soldiers” experiments. A solvent-controlled stereomutation is observed for chiral (S)-2 and (R)-2, which form helical supramolecular polymers of different handedness depending on the solvent (methylcyclohexane or toluene). The stereomutation is accounted for by considering the two possible conformations of the terminal phenyl groups, eclipsed or staggered, which lead to linear or helical self-assemblies, respectively, with different relative stabilities depending on the solvent.",

            "abstract": "Analyte concentration effects on the first reduction process of methyl viologens and diquat redox flow battery electrolytes were examined by cyclic voltammetry in aqueous media. A simple one-electron transfer mechanism to form radical cations was detected for diquat, 4,4′-dimethyl diquat, and bis(3-trimethylammonio)-propyl viologen compounds. The radical cations attach to the electrode surface when the source of their electrogeneration is methyl viologen molecules bearing PF6– ions as a counterpart. However, this inner sphere reduction mechanism was not observed in methyl viologen having an I– counterion. For the latter compound, as well as for 5,5′-dimethyl diquat and 1,1′-bis(3-sulfonatopropyl)-4,4′-bipyridinium, a piece of experimental evidence for unexpected, fast, and reversible dimerization interactions between their electrogenerated radical cations is presented. To get information on these bimolecular interactions, a screening methodology (using different levels of theory) was employed in finding suitable dimeric structures and their related interaction energies. By using diquat as a reference system, a relationship between calculated interaction energies and the corresponding experimental dimerization constants was obtained. The examination of redox-active molecules using this experimental and theoretical approach will allow a better selection of redox flow battery electrolytes.",

Transitions for a single species were observed, and the rotational constants for the parent and 18O isotopomers are consistent with a geometry that is highly averaged over a barrierless large-amplitude motion of water that interconverts two equivalent forms corresponding to the global minimum (B2PLYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP). In this effective geometry, the water lies above the thiophene ring close to its σv plane of symmetry. The observed transitions are split by a second water-centered tunneling motion that exchanges its two protons by internal rotation about its C2 axis with a calculated barrier of ∼2.7 kJ mol–1 (B2PLYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP). Based on quantum theory of atoms in molecules, noncovalent interaction, and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory analyses, the observed geometry enables two intermolecular interactions (O–H···π and O–H···S) whose electrostatic and dispersive contributions favor formation of the thiophene–water complex.",

Our results indicate that the most favorable pathway is a stepwise conjugate addition-Aldol sequence via the dual hydrogen-bond binding mode. The predicted level of enantioselectivity is in good agreement with experimental values. Trends in variation of substrates and catalysts have also been reproduced by our calculations.

            "abstract": "Rationale Isomerism is very common in nature, and the mass spectrometry (MS) behavior of isomers is highly similar, making their spectral analysis and identification difficult. Computational chemistry can effectively assist the study of MS spectra and molecule structures. Herein, three isomers of forsythoside (For-A, For-H, and For-I) were successfully identified using energy-resolved MS combined with density functional theory (DFT). Methods The MS scan spectra of the isomers were collected in electrospray ionization MS. The possible positive/negative ion adduct sites were investigated using the DFT method, and the molecular formation energy of each precursor ion was obtained. In the multireaction monitoring mode, the spectra of the common precursor ion → product ion pair of the three isomers were acquired under different collision energy, and the optimal collision energy (OCE) and maximum relative intensity (MRI) of each product ion were obtained. The energy of the broken chemical bond was calculated. Results The experimental data showed that the product ions of [M + H]+ of the three isomers have the greatest differences in OCE and MRI and were the most suitable to distinguish the three isomers. The DFT data showed that there was a good positive correlation between the bond fragmentation energy calculated by the quasi-molecular ion model and OCE. The results indicated that the energy of precursor ions and corresponding fragments could be correlated with their experimental spectra. Conclusions A strategy of combining energy-resolved MS and DFT was implemented on the recognition of forsythoside isomers, and this strategy was expected to be applied to the identification of more isomers.",

The photophysical characteristics of brominated dimer 1 were analyzed in comparison with non-halogenated dimers bis(β-H-BODIPY) (2), bis(β-CH3-BODIPY) (3), as well as dibromo-substituted mononuclear analogue β,β-dibromo-BODIPY (4). Dye 1 exhibits efficient fluorescence (from 53 to 72%) and 1O2 generation (from 19 to 42%) in solutions of nonpolar and weakly polar solvents. Dimerization leads to a high sensitivity of the fluorescence and generation characteristics of the halogenated dimer 1 to the solvent. The advantage of dimer 1 is a significantly lower tendency to aggregate compared to monomer 4. The conditions for the encapsulation of dye 1 in ZIF-8 nanoparticles and Pluronic® F127 micelles were determined and their structural and spectral characteristics were analyzed.",

            "abstract": "Small-molecule dyes are generally designed based on well-understood electronic effects. However, steric hindrance can promote excited-state geometric relaxation, increasing the difference between the positions of absorption and emission bands (the Stokes shift). Accordingly, we hypothesized that sterically induced central ring puckering in xanthene dyes could be used to systematically increase their Stokes shift. Through a combined experimental/quantum-chemical approach, we screened a group of (9-acylimino)-pyronin dyes with a perturbed central ring geometry. Our results showed that an atom with sp3 hybridization in position 10 of (9-acylimino)-pyronins induces central ring puckering and facilitates excited-state geometric relaxation, thereby markedly enhancing their Stokes shifts (by up to 2000 cm−1). Thus, we prepared fluorescent (9-acylimino)-pyronin pH sensors, which showed a Stokes shift disparity between acid and base forms of up to 8700 cm−1. Moreover, the concept of ring puckering-enhanced Stokes shift can be applied to a wide range of xanthene analogues found in the literature. Therefore, central ring puckering may be reliably used as a strategy for enhancing Stokes shifts in the rational design of dyes.",

The resulting low temperature IR spectra of the vacuum-isolated microsolvates in the OH stretching range are assigned based on harmonic DFT predictions for closed shell solvent dimers and trimers and their offset from experiment, to minimise theory-guided assignment bias. Systematic conformational preferences for the first and second solvent molecule are observed, depending on the conformational rigidity of the radical. These assignments are collected into an experimental benchmark data set and used to assess the spectral predicting power of different DFT approaches. The goal is to find inexpensive computational methods which provide reliable spectral predictions for this poorly explored class of microsolvates.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of 4-(Phenylselanyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (4-PSCO) on pain-associated proteins through computational molecular docking tests. A new pharmaceutical formulation based on polymeric nanocapsules was developed and characterized. The potential toxicity of 4-PSCO was assessed using Caenorhabditis elegans and Swiss mice, and its pharmacological actions through acute nociception and inflammation tests were also assessed. Our results demonstrated that 4-PSCO, in its free form, exhibited high affinity for the selected receptors, including p38 MAP kinase, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Janus kinase 2, toll-like receptor 4, and nuclear factor-kappa β. Both free and nanoencapsulated 4-PSCO showed no toxicity in nematodes and mice. Parameters related to oxidative stress and plasma markers showed no significant change. Both treatments demonstrated antinociceptive and anti-edematogenic effects in the glutamate and hot plate tests. The nanoencapsulated form exhibited a more prolonged effect, reducing mechanical hypersensitivity in an inflammatory pain model. These findings underscore the promising potential of 4-PSCO as an alternative for the development of more effective and safer drugs for the treatment of pain and inflammation.",

            "abstract": "Anion templation strategies have facilitated the synthesis of various catenane and rotaxane hosts capable of strong and selective binding of anions in competitive solvents. However, this approach has primarily relied on positively charged precursors, limiting the structural diversity and the range of potential applications of the anion-templated mechanically interlocked molecules. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of a rare electroneutral [2]catenane using a powerful, doubly charged sulfate template and a complementary diamidocarbazole-based hydrogen bonding precursor. Owing to the unique three-dimensional hydrogen bonding cavity and the embedded carbazole fluorophores, the resulting catenane receptor functions as a sensitive fluorescent turn-ON sensor for the highly hydrophilic sulfate, even in the presence of a large excess of water. Importantly, the [2]catenane exhibits enhanced binding affinity and selectivity for sulfate over its parent macrocycle and other acyclic diamidocarbazole-based receptors. We demonstrate also, for the first time, that the co-conformation of the catenane may be controlled by reversible acid/base induced protonation and deprotonation of the anionic template, SO42−. This approach pioneers a new strategy to induce molecular motion of interlocked components using switchable anionic templates.",

Redox-active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which partially rely on non-sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, -oxazole and -imidazole derivatives as redox-active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target molecules were identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical characterization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and used in organic polymer batteries.",

Additionally, we suggest accurate and effective quantum chemical methods to study accretion reactions between large unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxidized organic radicals. Furthermore, we examine the atmospheric relevance of these types of reactions by calculating the bimolecular reaction rate coefficients and formation rates under atmospheric conditions from the quantum chemical reaction energy barriers.",

            "container-title": "Chemical Science",
            "abstract": "A catalyst possessing a broad substrate scope, in terms of both turnover and enantioselectivity, is sometimes called “general”. Despite their great utility in asymmetric synthesis, truly general catalysts are difficult or expensive to discover via traditional high-throughput screening and are, therefore, rare. Existing computational tools accelerate the evaluation of reaction conditions from a pre-defined set of experiments to identify the most general ones, but cannot generate entirely new catalysts with enhanced substrate breadth. For these reasons, we report an inverse design strategy based on the open-source genetic algorithm NaviCatGA and on the OSCAR database of organocatalysts to simultaneously probe the catalyst and substrate scope and optimize generality as a primary target. We apply this strategy to the Pictet–Spengler condensation, for which we curate a database of 820 reactions, used to train statistical models of selectivity and activity. Starting from OSCAR, we define a combinatorial space of millions of catalyst possibilities, and perform evolutionary experiments on a diverse substrate scope that is representative of the whole chemical space of tetrahydro-β-carboline products. While privileged catalysts emerge, we show how genetic optimization can address the broader question of generality in asymmetric synthesis, extracting structure–performance relationships from the challenging areas of chemical space.",

Detailed characterization of their physicochemical properties is a prerequisite for understanding their biological functions. Herein, we examine acid–base and electromigration properties of selected CDNs employing capillary electrophoresis (CE), density functional theory (DFT), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to provide benchmark pKa values, as well as to unambiguously determine the protonation sites. Acidity constants (pKa) of the NH+ moieties of adenine and guanine bases and actual and limiting ionic mobilities of CDNs were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the pH dependence of their effective electrophoretic mobilities measured by CE in aqueous background electrolytes in a wide pH range (0.98–11.48), at constant temperature (25°C), and constant ionic strength (25 mM). The thermodynamic pKa values were found to be in the range 3.31–4.56 for adenine and 2.28–3.61 for guanine bases, whereas the pKa of enol group of guanine base was in the range 10.21–10.40. Except for systematic shifts of ∼2 pKa, the pKa values calculated by the DFT-D3//COSMO-RS composite protocol that included large-scale conformational sampling and “cross-morphing” were in a relatively good agreement with the pKas determined by CE and predict N1 atom of adenine and N7 atom of guanine as the protonation sites. The protonation of the N1 atom of adenine and N7 atom of guanine in acidic background electrolytes (BGEs) and the dissociation of the enol group of guanine in alkaline BGEs was confirmed also by NMR spectroscopy.",

            "abstract": "Metal hexafluorides hydrolyze at ambient temperature to deposit compounds having fluorine-to-oxygen ratios that depend upon the identity of the metal. Uranium-hexafluoride hydrolysis, for example, deposits uranyl fluoride (UO2F2), whereas molybdenum hexafluoride (MoF6) and tungsten hexafluoride deposit trioxides. Here, we pursue general strategies enabling the prediction of depositing compounds resulting from multi-step gas-phase reactions. To compare among the three metal-hexafluoride hydrolyses, we first investigate the mechanism of MoF6 hydrolysis using hybrid density functional theory (DFT). Intermediates are then validated by performing anharmonic vibrational simulations and comparing with infrared spectra [McNamara et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 25, 2990 (2023)]. Conceptual DFT, which is leveraged here to quantitatively evaluate site-specific electrophilicity and nucleophilicity metrics, is found to reliably predict qualitative deposition propensities for each intermediate. In addition to the nucleophilic potential of the oxygen ligands, several other contributing characteristics are discussed, including amphoterism, polyvalency, fluxionality, steric hindrance, dipolar strength, and solubility. To investigate the structure and composition of pre-nucleation clusters, an automated workflow is presented for the simulation of particle growth. The workflow entails a conformer search at the density functional tight-binding level, structural refinement at the hybrid DFT level, and computation of a composite free-energy profile. Such profiles can be used to estimate particle nucleation kinetics. Droplet formation is also considered, which helps to rationalize the different UO2F2 particle morphologies observed under varying levels of humidity. Development of predictive methods for simulating physical and chemical deposition processes is important for the advancement of material manufacturing involving coatings and thin films.",

Guided design of these polymers will benefit from detailed understanding of the performance of quantum-mechanical methods to be used for such tasks. Therefore, here we study performance of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for predicting binding energies, relative energies and excitation spectra of pyridine-SO3 and bipyridine-SO3 complexes, in the gas phase and solution. Ground-state properties are compared against DLPNO-CCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12 and CCSD(T)-F12 calculations. Excited state properties are compared to second-order Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction, ADC(2), and experimental data. For ground state properties, dispersion corrections make a massive improvement to computational data, with the revPBE-D4 functional specifically recommended for its accuracy, 1.5 kcal/mol error in the gas phase and 2.8 kcal/mol in ethanol. For excited-state properties, many density functionals perform quite well for predicting excitation energies, with most of them being range-separated hybrids or double-hybrids with spin-scaled correlation. However, oscillator strengths from these functionals massively differ from ADC(2), with oscillator strengths from lower-rung functionals like PBE, M06-L and BP86 closer to ADC(2).",

Mechanistic studies by NMR spectroscopy suggest reaction pathways of the carboxylic acid to acyl fluoride via outer-sphere fluorinations at an imidazolidinium ion by polyfluoride. DFT studies give further insight by exploring mechanistic details which distinguish the fluorination of aldehydes from that of carboxylic acids. Furthermore, a consecutive reaction sequence for the oxidation of an aldehyde followed by in situ fluorination of the generated carboxylic acid was developed.",

This compound, widely known as a by-product from the co-polymerization reactions of bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), has never been comprehensively characterized prior to this work. Herein, NMR and single crystal X-ray diffraction analyses have been conducted to investigate the molecular structural properties of cyclo-di-BADGE in the solution phase and solid state. Systematic conformational studies were carried out using the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST) in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Moreover, the aggregation behavior of cyclo-di-BADGE in organic and aqueous media was investigated through UV-Vis and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses. Detailed aggregation mechanisms were further probed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Finally, we investigated the binding of cyclo-di-BADGE with a model protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), through fluorescence and molecular docking analyses. Our studies provide valuable knowledge to facilitate the understanding of cyclo-di-BADGE in terms of its various physico-chemical properties and relevant effects on the environment and biological systems.",

The interaction of these BODIPYs with cells of microscopic fungi (Candida albicans and Fusarium solani) was studied. The compounds were found to be stable across a wide range of pH values and exhibited intense fluorescence (to φ ∼ 94%) at 508–587 nm. The introduction of a carboxylic acid residue into the meso-position of the BODIPY core causes a noticeable increase (almost ∼2 times) of the Stokes shift compared to the meso-unsubstituted analogues. On the other hand, α-carboxyl-BODIPYs showed a red shift in both the absorption and fluorescence bands. Effective fluorescence quenching (up to 40–80%) was observed in electron donor solvents for carboxyl-BODIPYs, especially for the carboxylic acid BODIPY with a thiophene substituent. The presence of a carboxyl group in the α-position of the BODIPY increased its affinity to hydrophilic media by approximately ∼1.2–2 times compared to meso-carboxyl-BODIPYs. Given the lack of cytotoxicity, carboxyl-BODIPYs may be recommended as effective biomarkers for examining the differences between a wide range of pathogens causing mycotic.",

The allant-ZnLSH biohybrid was synthesized by slow addition of a zinc chloride solution to an aqueous solution of allantoin, while adding a NaOH solution dropwise to maintain a controlled pH. The recovered precipitate was characterized by XRD, FTIR, chemical analysis, and FE-SEM. The allant-ZnLSH material was further incorporated into biopolymeric matrices such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and cellulose nanofibers (CNF), because of their biocompatibility and biodegradability. The resulting films presented suitable mechanical properties, with Young's modulus values ranging between 1.3 and 3.9 GPa, as well as appropriate water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) for application in would healing, around 250–630 g/m2 per day. The bionanocomposite films also showed interesting barrier properties against the passage of UV light, while keeping a certain transparency in the visible range that would allow the healing process to be monitored without removing the dressing. Their antibacterial action was evaluated against E. coli and S. aureus in agar plates, showing only antimicrobial activity against the latter. The goal is to develop materials that can exhibit antimicrobial, and skin regenerative properties provided by the presence of zinc ions and allantoin, respectively.",

However, applications of CPL are mainly in the field of materials science: special organic molecules and polymers, metal (lanthanide) complexes, and organic dyes are actively and intensely studied. So far natural compounds have not been investigated much. We fill the gap here by measuring circular dichroism (CD) and CPL of lycorine and narciclasine, the most abundant known alkaloid and isocarbostyril from Amaryllidaceae, which exhibit a large spectrum of biological activities and are promising anticancer compounds. Dual fluorescence detection in narciclasine led us to unveil an occurring excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process, this mechanism well accounts for the Stokes shift and CPL spectra observed in narciclasine. The same molecule is interesting also as a pH chiroptical switch. Both in absorption and emission, lycorine and narciclasine are also studied computationally via density functional theory (DFT) calculations further shedding light on their properties.",

            "abstract": "Photodynamic inhibition (PDI) of bacteria represents a powerful strategy for dealing with multidrug-resistant pathogens and infections, as it exhibits minimal development of antibiotic resistance. The PDI action stems from the generation of a triplet state in the photosensitizer (PS), which subsequently transfers energy or electrons to molecular oxygen, resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These ROS are then able to damage cells, eventually causing bacterial eradication. Enhancing the efficacy of PDI includes the introduction of heavy atoms to augment triplet generation in the PS, as well as membrane intercalation to circumvent the problem of the short lifetime of ROS. However, the former approach can pose safety and environmental concerns, while achieving stable membrane partitioning remains challenging due to the complex outer envelope of bacteria. Here, we introduce a novel PS, consisting of a metal-free donor–acceptor thiophene-based conjugate molecule (BV-1). It presents several advantageous features for achieving effective PDI, namely: (i) it exhibits strong light absorption due to the conjugated donor–acceptor moieties; (ii) it exhibits spontaneous and stable membrane partitioning thanks to its amphiphilicity, accompanied by a strong fluorescence turn-on; (iii) it undergoes metal-free intersystem crossing, which occurs preferentially when the molecule resides in the membrane. All these properties, which we rationalized via optical spectroscopies and calculations, enable the effective eradication of Escherichia coli, with an inhibition concentration that is below that of current state-of-the-art treatments. Our approach holds significant potential for the development of new PS for controlling bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative bacteria.",

Among the different chemistries that can be exploited, all-copper aqueous RFB (CuRFB) use low-cost, earth-abundant raw materials with a well-defined European supply chain. The CuRFB takes advantage of the three oxidation states of copper. As Cu(I) is not stable in aqueous media, the system is based on the chlorocomplexation of the copper cations. We demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate the complexation characteristic of the concentrated solutions used in CuRFB by investigating the speciation of copper (II) in electrolytes with increasing Cu(II) concentration. Spectro-electrochemical tests in diluted solution give information on the electrochemical behavior of electrolytes with a different chloro‑complexes distribution. Quantum chemical calculations elucidate the molecular structure and electronic transitions of water solvated copper chloro‑complexes, thus complementing the experimental picture.",

            "abstract": "Predicting values of the solvation free energy of ionic solutes is essential in chemical and biological processes as this property is required to model kinetics, electrochemical potentials, and acidity constants; however, developing computational prediction methods is challenging, partly because of the lack of accurate reference data. The state-of-the-art Minnesota solvation database reports an uncertainty of 3.0kcalmol−1 in the absolute solvation free energy of ionic solutes, which is large for further method development and validation. To reduce this uncertainty, we have created an accurate reference database, the database of ionic solutes’ solvation free energies (DISSOLVE). It consists of 330 ionic solvation free energy data entries of various chemical classes in water, dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol, and acetonitrile. The solvation free energy of these ionic solutes is determined by combining measured and computed values of the physical properties. We have extracted aqueous solvation energies of neutral solutes and pKa values from experimental studies in the literature. Using ab initio methods, we compute the gas phase acidity and non-aqueous solvation energy values of neutral solutes. On the basis of our analysis, we find that DISSOLVE entries are more accurate than the previously reported reference data in the literature, achieving a lower uncertainty of 1.5kcalmol−1 for aqueous and 2.6kcalmol−1 for non-aqueous absolute solvation free energies of ionic solutes. Additionally, we find an uncertainty of 1.0kcalmol−1 and 1.1kcalmol−1 for the conventional solvation free energies of ionic solutes in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions, respectively. With this improvement, our database enables the prediction of equilibrium and reaction rate constants within an order of magnitude, as well as the development and validation of new computational chemistry approaches for predicting the solvation free energy of ionic solutes.",

            "abstract": "Tri-propylene glycol methyl ether (TPGME) is a promising bio-based oxygenated fuel for advanced engines. The internal H-migration of peroxy (ROO) radicals is a critical factor in the process of TPGME autoignition. In this work, the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the internal H-migration of ROO radicals as well as alcohol elimination of TPGME were calculated with a high-level DLPNO-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP-D3/6–311++G(d,p) method. Rate constants for target reactions were then obtained over a temperature range of 300–1000 K using conventional transition state (CTST) theory. The rate constants for above reactions in the Burke’s model [Combust. Flame. 2015, 16 2(7), 2916–2927] were updated with the calculated results, followed by the modification for important reaction using an analogy strategy, to obtain a revised model. It was found that the feasibility of the H-migration of ROO radicals depended on the transition state ring size and the C-H bond energy of the transferred hydrogen atom, with 1, 5H-migration and 1, 6H-migration played a leading role in the process of TPGME autoignition. Validation against the shock tube (ST), jet stirred reactor (JSR) and collaborative fuel research (CFR) engine measurements from the literature showed that the revised model improved the prediction accuracy. In comparison to n-heptane, the CFR simulation proved that more available hydrogens of 1,5H-migration and 1,6H-migration, as well as higher concentrations and rate of production (ROP) for key low-temperature intermediate species, were contributing factors that stronger low-temperature oxidation activity of TPGME.",

Computational chemistry, which provides quantitative results of molecule parameters, is helpful for investigating the mechanisms of chemistry. Methods MS/MS spectra of five quinolones, namely norfloxacin (NOR), enoxacin (ENO), enrofloxacin (ENR), gatifloxacin (GAT), and lomefloxacin (LOM), were acquired for deciphering fragmentation pathways under multi-collision energy (CE). Computational methods were used for excluding little possibility pathways from the point of view of energy and stable conformations, whereas optimized collision energy (OCE) and maximum relative intensity (MRI) of major competitive fragments were investigated and confirmed using computational results. Results Fragmentation results of NOR, ENO, ENR, and GAT were deciphered using experimental and computational data, of which fragmentation regularities were summarized. Fragmentation pathways of LOM were deciphered under the guidance of foregoing regularities. Meanwhile, the whole process was validated by comparing OCE and MRI and computational energy results, which showed good agreement. Conclusions A strategy for explaining quinolone fragmentation results of multi-CE values and deciphering fragment mechanism using computational methods was developed. Relevant data and strategy may provide ideas for how to design and decipher new drug molecules with similar structures.",

Based on the highly regioselective and scalable bromination of a phenol precursor, a coupling process by Lipshutz cuprate oxidation was developed. A copper-mediated deracemization strategy proved to be superior to derivatization or kinetic resolution approaches. Key steps in the overall building block synthesis were rationalized through DFT studies. Utilizing the 2,2’-biphenol, a highly diastereoselective five step synthesis of formerly unknown (+)-di-epi-gonytolide A was developed, thus showcasing the building block's general potential for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives.

            "abstract": "Fucose is a signaling carbohydrate that is attached at the end of glycan processing. It is involved in a range of processes, such as the selectin-dependent leukocyte adhesion or pathogen-receptor interactions. Mass-spectrometric techniques, which are commonly used to determine the structure of glycans, frequently show fucose-containing chimeric fragments that obfuscate the analysis. The rearrangement leading to these fragments—often referred to as fucose migration—has been known for more than 25 years, but the chemical identity of the rearrangement product remains unclear. In this work, we combine ion-mobility spectrometry, radical-directed dissociation mass spectrometry, cryogenic IR spectroscopy of ions, and density-functional theory calculations to deduce the product of the rearrangement in the model trisaccharides Lewis x and blood group H2. The structural search yields the fucose moiety attached to the galactose with an α(1→6) glycosidic bond as the most likely product.",

            "abstract": "The reduction of the electrochemical window (EW) of electrolytes plays a significant role in assessing their compatibility with the anode in lithium-ion batteries. However, the accurate calculation of the reduction of EW is still challenging due to missing the solvation effects, condensation effects, kinetic factors, and the passivation on anodes. The theoretical prediction of the intrinsic and apparent EW is confirmed by a comprehensive experimental analysis of ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate (EC-DMC) electrolytes, combining linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The proposed novel kinetic normal distribution theory model can quantitatively explain the current density from LSV and affirm acetaldehyde (MeCHO) as one of the primary reduction products of EC. The solvent effect restricts the intrinsic EW of EC-DMC without lithium salt to 2.6 V (vs. Li+/Li) arising from the Marcus–Gerischer theory and the passivation of MeCHO on the anode broadens the apparent EW to 0.3 V (vs. Li+/Li) arising from the normal distribution of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for MeCHO produced by thermal motion. In addition, the passivation on the anode depends intensively on the lithium salt, resulting in more complicated influences on the apparent EW.",

Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy-to-obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.",

However, obtaining crystals of flexible and very soluble structures is troublesome. Nevertheless, a crystal structure of a highly flexible perylene-3,4 : 9,10-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (PBI) cyclophane was obtained and analysed to compare the chromophore arrangement in the solid state with theconfiguration in solution as well as with calculated structures. The crystal structure exhibits an intra- and intermolecular slip-stack arrangement of the heterochiral PBI units, forming a unique one-dimensional π-stacking supramolecular polymer-like structure. These findings emphasize that the unique solid-state arrangement of the chromophores cannot be easily predicted by elaborate studies in solution or by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, it features the importance of controlling the crystal packing to enable specific applications based on multiexciton generation processes where the spatial dependence and relative orientation of the chromophores are decisive parameters.",

On the other hand, hydrogen bonding between ether oxygens and trace water molecules fosters the eventual breakdown of the initial supramolecular aggregate.",

            "abstract": "Progesterone injection is oily because of its poor solubility. It is necessary to develop new dosage forms or delivery methods for Progesterone. Six cocrystals of Progesterone with nitrogen heterocyclic compounds (2,6-diaminopyridine, isonicotinamide, 4-aminopyridine, aminopyrazine, picolinamide and pyrazinamide) have been designed and prepared by ethyl acetate-assisted grinding, of which four cocrystals (2,6-diaminopyridine, isonicotinamide, 4-aminopyridine and aminopyrazine) had single crystal data in 1:1 stoichiometry. Metadynamics-genetic crossing was used to search and optimize various cluster structures to explain the reason the other two cocrystals could not be obtained with suitable size for single crystal X-ray diffraction. In contrast to the carboxyl group, the amide group and amino group were good substituents in the pyridine/pyrazine ring for cocrystallization with Progesterone, which meant inductive effect played an important role in nitrogen heterocyclic compounds containing reactive hydrogen. All cocrystals were more soluble than Progesterone in water, and Progesterone–pyrazinamide cocystal featured the best water solubility performance with an approximately six-fold increase over free Progesterone. This successful attempt provides an effective route for designing and manufacturing novel solid states of Progesterone.",

            "abstract": "To elucidate the adsorption mechanisms between the lignite and typical fractions from the wastewater, the microscopic adsorption behavior of ammonia nitrogen and phenol on the lignite surface was investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. Meanwhile, the interaction strength and properties of lignite structural units with ammonia nitrogen and phenol were examined by combining quantum chemical calculations and wave function analysis. The results showed that a small amount of NH4+ was adsorbed in the lignite structure, but most ions remained in the aqueous phase. Compared with NH4+, phenol was adsorbed more easily on the lignite surface. In addition to O···H hydrogen bond, there were cation-π interactions between NH4+ and lignite structural units. The main interactions between phenol and lignite structural units include π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding, as well as a small amount of van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The total hydrogen bond energy of the lignite structural unit to the four conformations of NH4+ as a percentage of the total binding energy was 72.34, 82.64, 51.00, and 51.02 %, respectively, while that for phenol was 40.94, 53.42, 62.18 and 73.31 %, respectively. And the electrostatic effects played a major role in the binding interaction of the NH4+ and lignite structural units, while the dispersion effects and electrostatic effects dominated the binding interaction of the phenol and lignite structural units. In the gas phase, the maximum binding energy between NH4+ and lignite structural units was higher than that between phenol and lignite. However, the binding energy between phenol and lignite structural units was higher in aqueous solution, which was consistent with the result that phenol was more easily adsorbed by lignite in molecular dynamics simulations.",

Sub-nanometer-scale aggregation patterns of monoethanolamine-(CO2)n, n=1–4, were identified. An interesting competition between the monoethanolamine intramolecular hydrogen bond and the intermolecular interactions between monoethanolamine and CO2 upon cluster growth was discovered, revealing an intriguing CO2 binding priority to the hydroxyl group over the amine group. These findings are in sharp contrast to the general results for aqueous solutions. In the quinary complex, a cap-like CO2 tetramer was observed cooperatively surrounding the monoethanolamine. As the cluster approaches the critical size of new particle formation, the contribution of CO2 self-assembly to the overall stability increases.",

The catalyst is a zwitterionic entity, in which acetate binds to CuII, which is formally negatively charged and serving as counterion for benzimidazolium. All 3 functionalities are involved in the catalytic activation. For maleimides productivity was increased by a factor >300 compared to literature (TONs up to 6700). High stereoselectivity and productivity was attained for a broad range of other Michael acceptors as well. The polyfunctional catalyst is accessible in only 4 steps from N-Ph-benzimidazole with an overall yield of 96 % and robust during catalysis. This allowed to reuse the same catalyst multiple times with nearly constant efficiency. Mechanistic studies, in particular by DFT, give a detailed picture how the catalyst operates. The benzimidazolium unit stabilizes the coordinated enolate nucleophile and prevents that acetate/acetic acid dissociate from the catalyst.",

            "abstract": "Melatonin is a neurohormone that ameliorates many health conditions when it is administered as a drug, but its drawbacks are its oral and intravenous fast release. To overcome the limitations associated with melatonin release, cyclodextrin-based nanosponges (CD-based NSs) can be used. Under their attractive properties, CD-based NSs are well-known to provide the sustained release of the drug. Green cyclodextrin (CD)-based molecularly imprinted nanosponges (MIP-NSs) are successfully synthesized by reacting β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD) or Methyl-β Cyclodextrin (M-βCD) with citric acid as a cross-linking agent at a 1:8 molar ratio, and melatonin is introduced as a template molecule. In addition, CD-based non-molecularly imprinted nanosponges (NIP-NSs) are synthesized following the same procedure as MIP-NSs without the presence of melatonin. The resulting polymers are characterized by CHNS-O Elemental, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Thermogravimetric (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Zeta Potential, and High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC-UV) analyses, etc. The encapsulation efficiencies are 60–90% for MIP-NSs and 20–40% for NIP-NSs, whereas melatonin loading capacities are 1–1.5% for MIP-NSs and 4–7% for NIP-NSs. A better-controlled drug release performance (pH = 7.4) for 24 h is displayed by the in vitro release study of MIP-NSs (30–50% released melatonin) than NIP-NSs (50–70% released melatonin) due to the different associations within the polymeric structure. Furthermore, a computational study, through the static simulations in the gas phase at a Geometry Frequency Non-covalent interactions (GFN2 level), is performed to support the inclusion complex between βCD and melatonin with the automatic energy exploration performed by Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). A total of 58% of the CD/melatonin interactions are dominated by weak forces. CD-based MIP-NSs and CD-based NIP-NSs are mixed with cream formulations for enhancing and sustaining the melatonin delivery into the skin. The efficiency of cream formulations is determined by stability, spreadability, viscosity, and pH. This development of a new skin formulation, based on an imprinting approach, will be of the utmost importance in future research at improving skin permeation through transdermal delivery, associated with narrow therapeutic windows or low bioavailability of drugs with various health benefits.",

            "abstract": "Conventional materials discovery is a laborious and time-consuming process that can take decades from initial conception of the material to commercialization. Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, an automated platform is introduced for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. This platform encompasses automated lego-like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end-to-end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, discovered eight potential candidates for organic lasers is discovered. The lasing threshold of four molecules in thin-film devices and find two molecules with state-of-the-art performance is tested. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.",

We modeled two competing reactions: a direct abstraction of hydrogen from a solvent molecule and solvolysis via photo-SN2Ar. Electron donating (–OMe, –CH2SiMe3, –SiMe3) and withdrawing (–CN) substituents not only have distinct effects on the triplet geometries, inducing structural distortions due to the relief of excited state antiaromaticity, but also affect the reactivity of the system. Therefore, electron-rich chlorobenzenes favor the radical reduction, while electron deficiency opens the possibility for solvolysis. Both reactions are energetically comparable to or more favorable then the dissociation of the C-Cl bond to form triplet or singlet aryl cations, the intermediates considered responsible for these reactivities. Our findings can be correlated with experimental results on similar systems available from the literature, deeming the proposed pathways as viable alternatives to established mechanisms involving aryl cations.",

Using computational methods (DFT/TD-DFT) as a guiding tool, six materials with a benzobisoxazole (BBO) core and donor–acceptor–donor architectures were designed by changing the conjugation position of carbazole-substituted phenyl substituents and the type of BBO isomer (cis- vs. trans-). Experimental steady-state and transient absorption spectroscopic techniques were utilized to probe the TADF activity of these molecules. Each material was then used in host–guest OLED devices as either near-UV dopants or host with low singlet-triplet energy differences. The electroluminescent properties show that when used as dopants these materials provide near-UV emission (CIEy < 0.06 and CIEx = 0.16), whereas when used as hosts, these materials show reduced operating voltages and increased performance efficiencies when compared to commercial materials.",

While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of β-d-xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin-spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino-xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.",

            "abstract": "Toxoplasmosis is an endemic neglected disease spread throughout the southern hemisphere, affecting a large part of the population concentrated in these countries. Aiming to develop new coordination compounds with anti-toxoplasma activity, we report herein the reactions between the mononuclear complexes [Cu(HL1)Cl2] (1), [Fe(HL1)Cl3] (2), and [Zn(HL1)Cl2] (3) (HL1 is the ligand N-2[(pyridine-2-ylmethyl)amino)ethanol)) and sodium sulfadiazine (NaSDZ), one of the current drugs used to treat toxoplasmosis. DFT data suggested that complexation reactions between complexes (1)-(3) and NaSDZ result in stable complexes (4)-(6), containing SDZ− in their coordination spheres, based on EDA (Energy Decomposition Analysis), which indicate favorable interaction between the metallic centers of the complexes and the anion SDZ−. The EDA results also suggest that the SDZ− anion donates negative charge to the metal, weakening the M-Cl interaction, present in complexes (1)-(3), and making the coordination with SDZ− anion easier. However, the reactions of (1) and (2) with NaSDZ were indeed ineffective, then complexes (4) and (5) were not obtained. Only the formation of [Zn(HL1)(SDZ)Cl].2H2O (6) was achieved, the product of the reaction between complex (3) and NaSDZ. Further analysis of DFT calculations and EDA data were carried out to understand the lack of the reactivity of compounds (1) and (2). The data revealed higher lability for the chloro ligand present in complex (3) and better stabilization of complex (6)’s HOMO. Steric and stacking effects could also justify these experimental data. This parallel theoretic-experimental study allowed us to conclude that complex (6) is the most probable to be obtained synthetically, in agreement with the experimental behavior. Furthermore, a complete characterization employing spectroscopic and electrochemical is presented for all the complexes, with and without SDZ− anion, including X-ray diffraction studies for complexes (1) and (6). The cytotoxic effects on T. gondii infecting LLC-MK2 host cells are presented and indicate that all the complexes reduced the parasite´s ability to proliferate. These results suggest that these compounds are promising, especially complex (2), which causes the death of the parasite.",

The route relies on a newly developed ppm level Au-catalyzed 5-endo-dig cyclization of ortho-acetylenic anilines to form the required indole moiety as a key step. Several examples showcase the generality of this cyclization. Assessment of the greenness of this approach is made by comparison of the overall E Factor, which is reduced by 54% relative to the existing route to tezacaftor. DFT analysis rationalizes the important role played by micellar nanoreactors, as well as indicating the location of the recyclable catalyst within the aqueous reaction medium.",

However, the knowledge of the structure-property relationship of RMLs is imperative for the design of highly efficient applications. Aiming to a better understanding of it at a molecular level, we performed an automated search for low energy structures of the most abundant RMLs, namely, Rha-C10, Rha-C10-C10, Rha-Rha-C10 and Rha-Rha-C10-C10 and their respective C2-congeners. Besides that, selected neutral metal complexes were also considered. We found that several low-energy congeners have internal hydrogen bonds. Moreover, geometries in “closed” conformation were always more stable than “open” ones. Finally, the energy diferences between open and closed conformations of K+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ complexes were found to be 23.5 kcal mol−1, 62.8 kcal mol−1, 24.3 kcal mol−1 and 41.6 kcal mol−1, respectively, indicating a huge structural reorganization after the complex formation.",

            "abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometry is arguably the most important analytical tool for structure elucidation of lipids and other metabolites. By fragmenting intact lipid ions, valuable structural information such as the lipid class and fatty acyl composition are readily obtainable. The information content of a fragment spectrum can often be increased by the addition of metal cations. In particular, the use of silver ions is deeply rooted in the history of lipidomics due to their propensity to coordinate both electron-rich heteroatoms and C = C bonds in aliphatic chains. Not surprisingly, coordination of silver ions was found to enable the distinction of sn-isomers in glycerolipids by inducing reproducible intensity differences in the fragment spectra, which could, however, not be rationalized. Here, we investigate the fragmentation behaviors of silver-adducted sn- and double bond glycerophospholipid isomers by probing fragment structures using cryogenic gas-phase infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Our results confirm that neutral headgroup loss from silver-adducted glycerophospholipids leads to dioxolane-type fragments generated by intramolecular cyclization. By combining high-resolution IR spectroscopy and computational modelling of silver-adducted fragments, we offer qualitative explanations for different fragmentation behaviors of glycerophospholipid isomers. Overall, the results demonstrate that gas-phase IR spectroscopy of fragment ions can significantly contribute to our understanding of lipid dissociation mechanisms and the influence of coordinating cations.",

The gelator was found to possess a strong gelation ability with the critical gelation concentration down to 0.45 wt% in dichloromethane (DCM). FT-IR NMR, XRD, SEM, theoretical calculation, and control experiment were combined to elucidate the assembly mechanism of gelator leading to gel. It was revealed that the hydrogen bonding associated with the triazole NH moiety plays a crucial role in the formation of the fibrillar gel network. This supramolecular gel demonstrated multiple-stimulus responsive (temperature, pH, metal ion) gel-sol phase transition behavior, particularly interesting aspect is that only 0.13 eq. F- is required to collapse the gel, representing the most sensitive supramolecular gel to F- anion up to now and endowing it with great potential as F- detector. The newly found Schiff base gelator reported here would offer prospects for the future design of more intelligent materials based on simple but versatile molecular scaffolds.",

Their planar structures and relative configurations were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis (HRESIMS and NMR). Based on a highly accurate conformer filtering protocol at low computational cost, the absolute configurations of full set 8,4′-oxy-8′-phenylneolignans were completely assigned by TDDFT calculations of ECD spectra for the first time. Furthermore, (+)/(−)-sophorol A, (−)-sophorol B, and (−)-sophorol E could moderately suppress the lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in murine macrophages at 10 μM, with inhibitory ratios of 48.4–52.9%.",

            "abstract": "Recently, Marina Bennati and coworkers (M. Bennati et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 2020, 59, 373–379., M. Bennati et al., J. Magn. Reson., 2021, 333, 107091) proposed to use electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy in the W-band for a pair of labels, nitroxide and 19F, for measurements of short (0.5–1.0 nm) distances in biomolecules. In our paper, we investigated the suitability of high-field ENDOR spectroscopy in the W-band for pairs of triarylmethyl and fluorine labels using five newly synthesized model compounds. It is shown that the application of strong magnetic fields allows distinguishing nuclear frequencies of 19F and protons with sufficient resolution. On the one hand, in contrast to nitroxides, for triarylmethyl radicals, it is not necessary to obtain spectra in different orientations owing to low g-factor anisotropic and long electron spin relaxation times of triarylmethyls. On the other hand, the size of the triarylmethyl radical is substantially larger than that of nitroxide and comparable with measured distances. We theoretically analyzed the suitability of the dipole–dipole approach for triarylmethyl to be used in a 19F ENDOR experiment and determined limitations of this approach. Finally, for comparison, we performed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) NMR on the same compounds. In addition, we applied this approach to study the process of a thiol exchange between molecules of triarylmethyl-labeled and 19F-labeled human serum albumin (HSA).",

On the other hand, the application of quantum chemistry methodologies for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between metal and biological matter can only be approached through adequate modelling of the chemical phenomena in object, sometimes also requiring the support of classical or semiempirical computational methods.

In this paper, we, for the first time, demonstrate that the concentration of buffer remarkably affects the stability of RSNOs including naturally occurring S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and synthetic S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). For a solution with a high concentration of GSNO (e.g., 50 mM) and an initial near-neutral pH, the optimal buffer concentration is close to the GSNO concentration under our experimental conditions. A lower buffer concentration does not have adequate buffer capacity to resist the pH drop caused by GSNO decomposition. The decreased solution pH further accelerates GSNO decomposition because GSNO is most stable at near-neutral pH according to our density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A higher-than-optimal buffer concentration also reduces the GSNO stability because buffer ingredients including phosphate, Tris base, and HEPES consume NO/N2O3. In contrast to GSNO, the highest SNAP stability is obtained when the starting solution at a neutral pH does not contain buffer species, and the stability decreases as the buffer concentration increases. This is because SNAP is more stable at mildly acidic pH and the SNAP decomposition-induced pH drop stabilizes the donor. When the RSNO concentration is low (e.g., 1 mM), the buffer concentration also matters because any excess buffer accelerates the donor decomposition. Since the effect of buffer concentration was previously overlooked and suboptimal buffer concentrations were often used, this paper will aid in the formulation of RSNO solutions to obtain the maximum stability for prolonged storage and sustained NO release.",

Experimentally, valence photoelectron spectra in the gas phase are measured using VUV radiation. Theoretically, we first obtain low-energy conformers through an automated conformer–rotamer ensemble sampling scheme based on tight-binding simulations. Then, different first principles computational schemes are considered to simulate the spectra: Hartree–Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT) within the B3LYP approximation, the quasi-particle GW correction, and the quantum-chemistry CCSD method. Theory allows assignment of the main features of the spectra. A discussion on the role of electronic correlation is provided, by comparing computationally cheaper DFT scheme (and GW) results with the accurate CCSD method.",

In this work, we examine how intermolecular interactions promote the ionic dissociation of such nanoclusters. To this end, a set of 45 HCl–water nanoclusters with up to four water molecules is introduced. Energy decomposition analysis based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMO-EDA) is employed in order to study the importance of frozen interaction, dispersion, polarization, and charge-transfer for the dissociation. The vertical ALMO-EDA scheme is applied to HCl–water clusters along a proton-transfer coordinate varying the amount of spectator water molecules. The corresponding ALMO-EDA results show a clear preference for the dissociated cluster only in the presence of four water molecules. Our analysis of adiabatic ALMO-EDA results reveals a push–pull mechanism for the destabilization of the HCl bond based on the synergy between forward and backward charge-transfer.",

High-throughput experimentation facilitated the screen of 90 different ligands and the resultant statistical data analysis identified that ligand σ-donation, π-acidity and sterics are key drivers that govern yield. Categorization into three ligand groups – monophosphines, bisphosphines and miscellaneous – was performed before the analysis. For the monophosphines, the yield of the reaction increases for strong σ-donating, weak π-accepting ligands, with flexible pendant substituents. For the bisphosphines, the yield predominantly correlates with ligand lability. The applicability of the designed reaction to a wider substrate scope was investigated, showing good functional group tolerance in particular with boronic acids bearing electron-withdrawing substituents. This work outlines the development of a novel reaction, coupled with a fast and efficient workflow to gain understanding of the optimal ligand properties for the design of improved palladium cross-coupling catalysts.",

In addition, DFT-predicted electronic spectra are used to evaluate the binding modes found. LFMM and DFT reproduce the experimentally determined coordination, a distorted square planar arrangement of 4 nitrogen ligands with axial coordination to a fifth, oxygen ligand. However, CREST conformational search was unsuccessful in predicting the coordination mode of Cu-DAHK, changing the bonding equatorial ligands from 4 N to 3N1O.",

The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of π-arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state-of-the-art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat-twist conformers, and thus suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilise the desired conformation.",

Although polarizable forcefields can provide improved accuracy, the computational efficiency of fixed charge molecular models is often preferred for larger systems. Here, we propose a multi-scale screening approach for analyzing the charge scaling behavior and other electrostatic properties of ILs, which is more attainable than previous analysis methods that rely on the IL crystalline structures. Based on isolated molecules and small clusters, we study the electrostatic potential properties and charges of multivalent IL molecules using density-functional theory calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The charges of the IL molecules are calculated and compared using several different charge estimation techniques. Although there are some differences among the estimated partial charges on the atoms, the total anion and cation charges are very similar. The charge scaling factors are substantial, and they are only slightly affected by the IL cluster size model.",

Two monohydrates, three dihydrates and for the first time three trihydrates were identified through the observation of the parent and 18O isotopologues in the rotational spectrum from 2 to 20 GHz. For each hydrate, the sets of rotational constants enabled the determination of the substitution coordinates of the oxygen water atoms as well as an effective structure accounting for the arrangement of the water molecules around fenchone. The hydrates consist of water chains anchored to fenchone by a –CO⋯H–O hydrogen bond and further stabilized by numerous –H–O⋯H–C– secondary hydrogen bonds with the alkyl hydrogen atoms of fenchone.",

            "abstract": "Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is a major public health problem affecting about 6 to 7 million people worldwide, mostly in Latin America. The available therapy for this disease is based on two drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, which exhibit severe side effects, including resistance, severe cytotoxicity, variable efficacy and inefficiency in the chronic phase. Therefore, new drugs are urgently needed. Coordination compounds may be an interesting alternative for antiparasite therapy against Leishmania spp., Toxoplasma gondii and T. cruzi. Herein, we tested the in vitro effect on T. cruzi epimastigotes (Y strain) of two new μ-oxo Fe(III) dinuclear complexes: [(HL1)(Cl)Fe(μ-O)Fe(Cl)(HL2)](Cl)2·(CH3CH2OH)2·H2O (1) and [(HL2)(Cl)Fe(μ-O)Fe(Cl)(HL2)](Cl)2·H2O (2) where HL1 and HL2 are ligands which contain two pyridines, amine and alcohol moieties with a naphthyl pendant unit yielding a N3O coordination environment. Complexes (1) and (2), which are isomers, were completely characterized, including X-ray diffraction studies for complex (1). Parasites were treated with the complexes and the outcome was analyzed. Complex (1) exhibited the lowest IC50 values, which were 99 ± 3, 97 ± 2 and 110 ± 39 nM, after 48, 72 and 120 h of treatment, respectively. Complex (2) showed IC50 values of 118 ± 5, 122 ± 6 and 104 ± 29 nM for the same treatment times. Low cytotoxicity to the host cell LLC-MK2 was found for both complexes, resulting in impressive selectivity indexes of 106 for complex (1) and 178 for (2), after 120 h of treatment. Treatment with both complexes reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential of the parasite. Ultrastructural analysis of the parasite after treatment with complexes showed that the mitochondria outer membrane presented swelling and abnormal disposition around the kinetoplast; in addition, reservosomes presented anomalous spicules and rupture. The complexes showed low nanomolar IC50 values affecting mitochondria and reservosomes, essential organelles for the survival of the parasite. The low IC50 and the high selectivity index show that both complexes act as a new prototype of drugs against T. cruzi and may be used for further development in drug discovery to treat Chagas disease.",

Here we demonstrate the use of a series of Zn2(X-bdc)2(dabco) (where X-bdc2− is bdc2− = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate with substituting groups X, DM-bdc2− = 2,5-dimethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate or TM-bdc2− = 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate and dabco = diazabicyclo[2.2.2.]octane) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for the adsorptive removal of ethane from ethylene streams. The best performing material from this series is Zn2(TM-bdc)2(dabco) (DMOF-TM), which shows a high ethane uptake of 5.31 mmol g−1 at 110 kPa, with a good IAST selectivity of 1.88 towards ethane over ethylene. Through breakthrough measurements a high productivity of 13.1 L kg−1 per breakthrough is revealed with good reproducibility over five consecutive cycles. Molecular simulations show that the methyl groups of DMOF-TM are forming a van der Waals trap with the methylene groups from dabco, snuggly fitting the ethane. Further, rarely used high pressure coadsorption measurements, in pressure regimes that most scientific studies on hydrocarbon separation on MOFs ignore, reveal an increase in ethane capacity and selectivity for binary mixtures with increased pressures. The coadsorption measurements reveal good selectivity of 1.96 at 1000 kPa, which is verified also through IAST calculations up to 3000 kPa. This study overall showcases the opportunities that pore engineering by alkyl group incorporation and pressure increase offer to improve hydrocarbon separation in reticular materials.",

By confining the hydroxyl groups with inferior oxidative stability to the c-PEGR backbone, the oxidation potential of the PEG-based polymer material with reduced reactivity is boosted to 4.36 V. The c-PEGR based gel electrolyte shows excellent flexibility, lithium-ion transport, lithium compatibility, and enhanced oxidation stability, and is successfully applied to a 4.35 V lithium cobaltate (LCO)||lithium (Li) battery system. A quasi-static linear scanning voltammetry (QS-LSV) method is proposed for the first time to accurately measure the oxidation potential and electrochemical stability window of materials with low conductivities such as polymers, which possesses the advantages of high accuracy and short test time. This work provides new insights and research techniques for selecting polymer electrolytes for high-voltage flexible lithium-ion batteries (LIBs).",

            "abstract": "Broadband rotational spectra of cis- and trans-(−)-carveol were recorded using a chirped pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometer in the 2–6 GHz region. To aid in spectroscopic assignments a theoretical conformational search was carried out using a combination of a two dimensional potential energy scan, scanning over the isopropenyl and hydroxyl groups torsional angles, and the Conformer–Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool. The theoretical results yielded a total of 23 conformers for the trans- and 19 for the cis-conformer. Utilizing these results, a total of five conformers could be assigned in the spectra, two for trans- and three for cis-(−)-carveol. In both conformers of trans-carveol, the isopropenyl group is in an equatorial position and adopts the gauche− conformation in one and the the antiperiplanar conformation in the other, with the hydroxyl group in the axial position and adopting the antiperiplanar conformation in both. For cis-carveol the analogous conformers were found but with the hydroxyl in a equatorial position, in addition to an axial isopropenyl conformer. To interpret the experimental intensity patterns and examine conformational cooling effects, transition states were identified using the Synchronous Transit Quasi-Newton method. We found that most of the higher energy conformers cool out to the five experimentally observed ones and the others are too high in energy to be sufficiently populated in the molecular expansion for an experimental observation. To investigate the interesting preference for the axial position of the isopropenyl group in cis-(−)-carveol, which has not been seen before in monoterpenoids, non-covalent interactions and quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules analyses were carried out. These analyses reveal a hydrogen bonding interaction between the hydroxyl group and the isopropenyl π-system. A natural bond orbital analysis of the hydrogen bond allowed us to decompose the interaction into its constituent natural bond orbitals, and to quantify its strength. Although relatively weak, the hydrogen bond tips the balance towards the axial position of the isopropenyl group.",

Most high-value applications require precise control of TA interactions with the system of interest. However, the molecular structure of TA is still not comprehended at the atomic level, of which all electronic and reactivity properties depend. Here, we combine an enhanced sampling global optimization method with density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to explore the conformational space of TA assisted by unsupervised machine learning visualization and then investigate its lowest energy conformers. We study the external environment’s effect on the TA structure and properties. We find that vacuum favors compact structures by stabilizing peripheral atoms’ weak interactions, while in water, the molecule adopts more open conformations. The frontier molecular orbitals of the conformers with the lowest harmonic vibrational free energy have a HOMO–LUMO energy gap of 2.21 (3.27) eV, increasing to 2.82 (3.88) eV in water, at the DFT generalized gradient approximation (and hybrid) level of theory. Structural differences also change the distribution of potential reactive sites. We establish the fundamental importance of accurate structural consideration in determining TA and related polyphenol interactions in relevant technological applications.",

However, given the sheer size of biomolecules, it is expected that dispersion forces could also play a determining role for aggregate formation and associated chirality recognition. With the example of diol molecules, we explore different factors in the formation of homo- and hetero-dimers as well as their relative stability. By comparing density functional results with the analysis of local correlation methods, we infer the impact of dispersion not only on the energies but also on the structures of such chiral aggregates. A local orbital based scheme is used to calculate wave function dispersion-free gradients and compare to uncorrected density functional structures.",

The first described PBs were formyloxobilin-type PBs, but dioxobilin-type PBs also occur naturally. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of the blue Zn(II) complex of a dioxobilin-type pink PB, which chelates a Zn(II) ion fast and tightly in an effectively tridentate manner. The optically active Zn complex featured bright chelation enhanced red fluorescence and exhibited strikingly differing spectral properties in methanol and in acetonitrile. Computational studies based on DFT-calculations gave detailed insights into low energy structures of the Zn complex in both solvents and provided support for the proposed role of solvent in the coordination sphere of the bound Zn(II) ion.",

            "abstract": "We document the design, synthesis, and characterization of the first low glass transition temperature, n-type (i.e., preferentially-reduced) radical polymer. Specifically, a macromolecule composed of a polysiloxane backbone that bears galvinoxyl radical pendant groups, poly[2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-((3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-(λ1-oxidaneyl)phenyl)(4-((3-(methoxydimethylsilyl)propoxy) methyl)phenyl)methylene)cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one] (PGMS), was created as our calculations predicted that the galvinoxyl radical molecular structure would facilitate radical–radical aggregation. In turn, this suggested that charge transport would be rapid in these systems, which would lead to large solid-state electronic conductivity values. After the design and successful synthesis of the PGMS radical polymers, their optical, spin, thermal, and electrochemical properties were evaluated in full. These experiments backed the idea that PGMS has a low glass transition temperature and robust electrochemical behavior. Furthermore, when a PGMS macromolecule was cast into a thin film, a solid-state conductivity of 10−2 S m−1 was achieved, and this was despite the fact that only ∼36% of the pendant groups contained a galvinoxyl radical. This high conductivity appears to be a direct result of the radical–radical aggregation that occurs due to the molecular design of the galvinoxyl radical species. Therefore, this work highlights the import of developing next-generation open-shell entities for solid-state radical polymer conductors, and it provides a clear path forward for creating high conductivity, non-conjugated conducting macromolecules.",

Isolated THFA exists dominantly as three different conformers: I, II, and III in a jet, with I and II taking on the trans-COOH configuration and III having the cis-COOH configuration. We utilized CREST, a conformational ensemble space exploration tool, to identify the possible conformations of the binary adduct, THFA⋅⋅⋅PO. Subsequent DFT geometry optimizations predicted about two hundred homochiral and heterochiral binary structures with 28 low energy structures within an energy window of 15 kJ mol−1. A rich broadband rotational spectrum was obtained with a mixture of trace amounts of THFA+PO in neon in a supersonic jet expansion. Six THFA⋅⋅⋅PO conformers were identified experimentally. Kinetically favored binary products which contain trans-COOH I dominate among the observed conformers, while thermodynamically more stable adducts were also detected. Detailed analyses of the structures of the observed conformers show interesting chirality-controlled structural preferences. Such non-covalently bound chiral contact pairs are the foundation of chiral-tag rotational spectroscopy, an exciting new analytical application of rotational spectroscopy for determination of enantiomeric excess. Enantiomeric excess analyses were performed and the results are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Small molecule receptor-binding is dominated by weak, non-covalent interactions such as van-der-Waals hydrogen bonding or electrostatics. Calculating these non-covalent ligand-receptor interactions is a challenge to computational means in terms of accuracy and efficacy since the ligand may bind in a number of thermally accessible conformations. The conformational rotamer ensemble sampling tool (CREST) uses an iterative scheme to efficiently sample the conformational space and calculates energies using the semi-empirical ‘Geometry, Frequency, Noncovalent, eXtended Tight Binding’ (GFN2-xTB) method. This combined approach is applied to blind predictions of the modes and free energies of binding for a set of 10 drug molecule ligands to the cucurbit[n]urils CB[8] receptor from the recent ‘Statistical Assessment of the Modeling of Proteins and Ligands’ (SAMPL) challenge including morphine, hydromorphine, cocaine, fentanyl, and ketamine. For each system, the conformational space was sufficiently sampled for the free ligand and the ligand-receptor complexes using the quantum chemical Hamiltonian. A multitude of structures makes up the final conformer-rotamer ensemble, for which then free energies of binding are calculated. For those large and complex molecules, the results are in good agreement with experimental values with a mean error of 3 kcal/mol. The GFN2-xTB energies of binding are validated by advanced density functional theory calculations and found to be in good agreement. The efficacy of the automated QM sampling workflow allows the extension towards other complex molecular interaction scenarios.",

            "abstract": "Peptidomimetic macrocycles have the potential to regulate challenging therapeutic targets. Structures of this type having precise shapes and drug-like character are particularly coveted, but are relatively difficult to synthesize. Our laboratory has developed robust methods that integrate small-peptide units into designed scaffolds. These methods create macrocycles and embed condensed heterocycles to diversify outcomes and improve pharmacological properties. The hypothetical scope of the methodology is vast and far outpaces the capacity of our experimental format. We now describe a computational rendering of our methodology that creates an in silico three-dimensional library of composite peptidic macrocycles. Our open-source platform, CPMG (Composite Peptide Macrocycle Generator), has algorithmically generated a library of 2,020,794,198 macrocycles that can result from the multistep reaction sequences we have developed. Structures are generated based on predicted site reactivity and filtered on the basis of physical and three-dimensional properties to identify maximally diverse compounds for prioritization. For conformational analyses, we also introduce ConfBuster++, an RDKit port of the open-source software ConfBuster, which allows facile integration with CPMG and ready parallelization for better scalability. Our approach deeply probes ligand space accessible via our synthetic methodology and provides a resource for large-scale virtual screening.",

We herein report a comprehensive computational and experimental study of the compensation of London dispersion in proton-bound dimer dissociations showing that total compensation is largely invariant in both polar and nonpolar aprotic solvents spanning a wide range of bulk polarizabilities. Additionally, we find that compensation by solvent (which is about 40–80 %) largely dominates over compensation in the gas phase (which is about 0–40 %) for typical experimental temperatures.",

This work presents a direct synthesis of this group and explores its properties. The TFTB group arises when the methyl groups of a tert-butyl moiety are exchanged for fluoromethyl groups. Sequential fluoromethylations result in a decrease of Log P (increasing hydrophilicity), ultimately by 1.7 Log P units in the TFTB group relative to that of tert-butyl benzene itself. A focus is placed on synthetic transformations, conformational analysis, and metabolism of the TFTB group in the context of presenting a favorable profile as a motif for the discovery of bioactives.",

            "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a psychiatric disease having approximately a 20% lifetime prevalence in adults in the United States (U.S.), as reported by Hasin et al. in JAMA Psichiatry 2018 75, 336–346. Symptoms include low mood, anhedonia, decreased energy, alteration in appetite and weight, irritability, sleep disturbances, and cognitive deficits. Comorbidity is frequent, and patients show decreased social functioning and a high mortality rate. Environmental and genetic factors favor the development of depression, but the mechanisms by which stress negatively impacts on the brain are still not fully understood. Several recent works, mainly published during the last five years, aim at investigating the correlation between treatment with fluoxetine, a non-tricyclic antidepressant drug, and the amelioration of oxidative stress. In this work, the antioxidant activity of fluoxetine was investigated using a computational protocol based on the density functional theory approach. Particularly, the scavenging of five radicals (HO•, HOO•, CH3OO•, CH2=CHOO•, and CH3O•) was considered, focusing on hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical adduct formation (RAF) mechanisms. Thermodynamic as well as kinetic aspects are discussed, and, for completeness, two metabolites of fluoxetine and serotonin, whose extracellular concentration is enhanced by fluoxetine, are included in our analysis. Indeed, fluoxetine may act as a radical scavenger, and exhibits selectivity for HO• and CH3O•, but is inefficient toward peroxyl radicals. In contrast, the radical scavenging efficiency of serotonin, which has been demonstrated in vitro, is significant, and this supports the idea of an indirect antioxidant efficiency of fluoxetine.",

            "abstract": "Diadamantyl ether (DAE, C20H30O) represents a good model to study the interplay between London dispersion and hydrogen-bond interactions. By using broadband rotational spectroscopy, an accurate experimental structure of the diadamantyl ether monomer is obtained and its aggregates with water and a variety of aliphatic alcohols of increasing size are analyzed. In the monomer, C−H⋅⋅⋅H−C London dispersion attractions between the two adamantyl subunits further stabilize its structure. Water and the alcohol partners bind to diadamantyl ether through hydrogen bonding and non-covalent Owater/alcohol⋅⋅⋅H−CDAE and C−Halcohol⋅⋅⋅H−CDAE interactions. Electrostatic contributions drive the stabilization of all the complexes, whereas London dispersion interactions become more pronounced with increasing size of the alcohol. Complexes with dominant dispersion contributions are significantly higher in energy and were not observed in the experiment. The results presented herein shed light on the first steps of microsolvation and aggregation of molecular complexes with London dispersion energy donor (DED) groups and the kind of interactions that control them.",

            "abstract": "A multitude of applications related to perhydroxylated closo-dodecaborate B12(OH)122− in the condensed phase are inseparable from the fundamental mechanisms underlying the high water orientation selectivity based on the base B12(OH)122−. Herein, we directly compare the structural evolution of water clusters, ranging from monomer to hexamer, oriented by functional groups in the bases B12H122−, B12H11OH2− and B12(OH)122− using multiple theoretical methods. A significant revelation is made regarding B12(OH)122−: each additional water molecule is locked into the intramolecular hydrogen bond B–O–H ternary ring in an embedded form. This new pattern of water cluster growth suggests that B–(H–O)⋯H–O interactions prevail over the competition from water–hydrogen bonds (O⋯H–O), distinguishing it from the behavior observed in B12H122− and B12H11OH2− bases, in which competition arises from a mixed competing model involving dihydrogen bonds (B–H⋯H–O), conventional hydrogen bonds (B–(H–O)⋯H–O) and water hydrogen bonds (O⋯H–O). Through aqueous solvation and ab initio molecular dynamics analysis, we further demonstrate the largest water clusters in the first hydrated shell with exceptional thermodynamic stability around B12(OH)122−. These findings provide a solid scientific foundation for the design of boron cluster chemistry incorporating hydroxyl-group-modified borate salts with potential implications for various applications.",

            "abstract": "While enol-keto tautomerism has attracted great interest in Schiff bases and related compounds in solution and crystal states, the self-assembly of energy-unfavored keto form were scarcely investigated. Here, we report a keto-form directed self-assembly of a naphthalene-attached enantiomeric N-salicylideneanil analog L/DGG-Nap accompanied with a significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). It was found that LGG-Nap exists as a mixture of enol and keto form in monomer at a diluted toluene solution. The increment of the concentrations leads to the formation of predominated keto form, which subsequently triggers the self-assembly. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) revealed that a hierarchical assembly process happened upon increasing the concentration of LGG-Nap in toluene. Individual nanofibers formed at 1 × 10−4 mol/L and transferred into helical nanofiber bundles in 5 × 10−3 mol/L. Interestingly, while these is nearly no circular dichroism (CD) or CPL in the monomeric solution, the assembly showed strong CD and CPL. Remarkably, the dissymmetry factor (glum) was significantly amplified from zero in solution through the 0.005 in individual nanofiber to 0.1 in nanofiber bundles. This work demonstrates that the enol-keto tautomerism can be broken and trigger the self-assembly upon increasing the concentration, which can subsequently direct the chiral self-assembly and significantly amplify the dissymmetry factor of assembled CPL materials.",

Состав комплексов определялся кислотностью среды и порядком смешения. Показано, что увеличение количества целлобиозных единиц Na-САЦ на моль AБ коррелирует со снижением значения pH. Образование комплекса исследовали методами инфракрасной фурье-спектроскопии, термического анализа, рентгеноструктурного анализа, лазерной дифракции, анализа траектории движения наночастиц и сканирующей электронной микроскопии. Квантово-химическое исследование относительной стабильности протонированных форм КАН в водном растворе было выполнено для определения предпочтительных центров протонирования молекулы КАН. Значения pKa для КАН рассчитывались с помощью метода изодесмических реакций. Структуры и энергия связи для димера КАН и комплекса КАН – САЦ также исследованы квантово-химическими методами. Выявлено, что сам комплекс Na-САЦ – КАН, иммобилизованный на активированном угле, демонстрирует in vitro в два раза большую антибактериальную активность в сравнении со стандартной (инъекционной) формой КАН против Mycobacterium tuberculosis и может быть рекомендован для клинических испытаний in vivo как новая форма аминогликозида AБ для перорального применения.",

Quinomycins K (1) and L (2), two rare quinomycin-type octadepsipeptides without intra-peptide disulfide or thioacetal bridges, were investigated from the Maowei Sea mangrove-derived Streptomyces sp. B475. Their chemical structures, including the absolute configurations of their amino acids, were elucidated by a combination of NMR and tandem MS analysis, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculation, advanced Marfey’s method, and further unequivocally confirmed by the first total synthesis. The two compounds displayed no potent antibacterial activity against 37 bacterial pathogens and had no significant cytotoxic activity against H460 lung cancer cells.",

Experimental and theoretical infrared spectra confirmed that the inclusion complex was successfully prepared. Phase solubility studies suggested the formation of 1:1 stoichiometric inclusion complex of cholesterol with β-CD. The inclusion complex showed higher decomposed temperature (327.3 °C) than physical mixture (321.6 °C), indicating improved thermal stability of inclusion complex. Conformational search and density functional theory calculations were performed to find the most stable conformation with the lowest complexation energy (−129.66 kJ/mol). Dispersion energy from van der Waals (−283.31 kJ/mol) contributed greatly on total bonding energy (−204.72 kJ/mol). The bond lengths of hydrogen bonds (O127⋅⋅⋅H221 and O220⋅⋅⋅H107) were 1.77 and 1.62 Å, respectively. Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds were necessary to drive spontaneous formation and maintain the stability of inclusion complex. This study revealed a deep insight into the formation mechanism of cholesterol/β-CD inclusion complex using computational and experimental approaches, providing theoretical basis for the removal of cholesterol from hydrocolloid-containing systems.",

            "abstract": "To enable effective treatment of coal slime and prevent its release as an environmental pollutant, the interaction between coal particles in aqueous solutions must be well understood to enhance flocculation and sedimentation of the coal. In this study, the interaction between coal particles was explored using experiments and molecular simulations, which revealed the self-aggregation behavior of lignite and anthracite at different coalification levels in water. Atomic force microscopy results indicated that the anthracite–anthracite adhesion force is greater than that of lignite–lignite, and the adhesion force dominates particle interactions. The surface electrostatic potential range of lignite (-85.57–87.67 kcal/mol) is much higher than that of anthracite (-63.68–59.60 kcal/mol) and the lignite surface provides more polar regions for adsorbing water molecules. Lignite and anthracite rely on π–π accumulation to form a dimer skeleton structure. The dispersion interaction, dominated by π–π interactions, is key to promoting cluster formation and maintaining a stable cluster. The coal molecules proceed through three stages of movement, forming a cluster structure by dissipating the surrounding water molecules. The hydrophobic surface of the cluster molecules is exposed, gradually concealing the hydrophilic groups, which maintains the stability of coal self-aggregates. This process affects the water-molecule distribution, damaging the water bridge structure formed between the water molecules in coal molecule interlayers. This results in a decrease in the average number of water molecules surrounding a single lignite or anthracite molecule, and a change in the water-molecule orientation. Therefore, to enhance the flocculation of coal particles in slime water, it is necessary to increase the hydrophobicity of low-rank coal particles.",

Infrared photodissociation spectra of mass-selected [TaO3(CO2)n]+ complexes were recorded in the frequency region from 2200 to 2450 cm−1 and assigned through comparing with the simulated infrared spectra of energetically low-lying structures derived from quantum chemical calculations. With the increasing number of attached CO2 molecules, the larger clusters show significantly enhanced fragmentation efficiency and a strong band appears at around 2350 cm−1 near the free CO2 antisymmetric stretching vibration band, indicating only a small perturbation of CO2 molecules on the secondary solvation sphere while higher frequency bands corresponding to the core structure remain largely unaffected. A core structure [TaO3(CO2)3]+ is identified to which subsequent CO2 ligands are weakly attached and the most favorable cluster growth path is verified to proceed on the triplet potential energy surface higher in energy than that of ground states. Theoretical exploration reveals a two-state reactivity (TSR) scenario in which the energetically favored triplet transition state crosses over the singlet ground state to form a TaO3+ core ion, providing new information on the cluster formation correlated with the reactivity of tantalum metal oxides towards CO2.",

Surprisingly, the resulting metallosupramolecular aggregates formed in solution upon coordination of [(dppp)Pd(OTf)2] differ in their composition: whereas Lnit forms dinuclear complexes, Liso exclusively forms trinuclear ones. Furthermore, they also differ in their chiral self-sorting behavior as (rac)-Liso undergoes exclusive social self-sorting leading to a heterochiral assembly, whereas (rac)-Liso shows a twofold preference for the formation of homochiral complexes in a narcissistic self-sorting manner as proven by ESI mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, upon crystallization, these discrete aggregates undergo structural transformation to coordination polymers, as evidenced by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.",

            "abstract": "The interactions between organic pollutants and iron minerals play an important role in their environmental fate. In this study, the effects of low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) on the adsorption and degradation of tetracycline (TC) on goethite were investigated. Tartaric acid (TA) was taken as the representative of LMWOAs to study the influencing mechanism through batch experiments and microscale characterization. In addition, the properties of TC-TA clusters under different pHs were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results showed that all five LMWOAs inhibited TC adsorption and degradation. The preferential adsorption of TA on goethite changed TC adsorption from inner spherical to outer spherical complexation and mainly inhibited TC adsorption and degradation of the singly coordinated hydroxyl group. TC degradation rate decreased from 0.0287 to 0 h−1 in the first stage. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results showed that TA could influence the interactions of amide groups, C = O on the A-ring, and dimethylamino group of TC with goethite, and the formation of ≡Fe(II) was inhibited. In addition to competing for the effective sites, the effects of complexation between TA and TC in solution should be considered. According to DFT calculations, hydrogen bonds could be formed between the carboxyl group of TA and the H atom of TC at different pH. These findings can provide evidence for estimating the contribution of adsorption and degradation to TC removal by iron oxides with the coexistence of LMWOAs in a soil–water environment.",

We employed functional group methylation experiments combined with molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations to reveal the disaggregation mechanism of asphaltenes based on the chemical alteration method. Here, the experimental results show that the intersheet distances in the asphaltene aggregate increase after the methylation reaction, and the asphaltene molecules are not prone to reaggregation after methylation, which was demonstrated by an increase in the critical aggregation concentration in toluene. These disaggregation effects can be explained by the theoretical study results; that is, they can be attributed to the reduction of the electrostatic interaction, which is derived from the disappearance of the hydrogen bonds after methylation. However, a thorough disaggregation cannot be achieved only by methylation because the van der Waals force is always the dominant force in both raw and methylated asphaltenes, outweighing the electrostatic force. Asphaltene molecules with very short side chains containing more than one terminal polar group could obtain a better disaggregation effect by the methylation reaction, whereas those with long chains could not. Our results provide the underlying insights for the proposal of an effective method for asphaltene disaggregation to prevent coking.",

            "abstract": "The only recently discovered gem-hydrogenation of internal alkynes is a fundamentally new transformation, in which both H atoms of dihydrogen are transferred to the same C atom of a triple bond while the other position transforms into a discrete metal carbene complex. [Cp*RuCl]4 is presently the catalyst of choice: the resulting piano-stool ruthenium carbenes can engage a tethered alkene into either cyclopropanation or metathesis, and a prototypical example of such a reactive intermediate with an olefin ligated to the ruthenium center has been isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction. It is the substitution pattern of the olefin that determines whether metathesis or cyclopropanation takes place: a systematic survey using alkenes of largely different character in combination with a computational study of the mechanism at the local coupled cluster level of theory allowed the preparative results to be sorted and an intuitive model with predictive power to be proposed. This model links the course of the reaction to the polarization of the double bond as well as to the stability of the secondary carbene complex formed, if metathesis were to take place. The first application of “hydrogenative metathesis” to the total synthesis of sinularones E and F concurred with this interpretation and allowed the proposed structure of these marine natural products to be confirmed. During this synthesis, it was found that gem-hydrogenation also provides opportunities for C–H functionalization. Moreover, silylated alkynes are shown to participate well in hydrogenative metathesis, which opens a new entry into valuable allylsilane building blocks. Crystallographic evidence suggests that the polarized [Ru–Cl] bond of the catalyst interacts with the neighboring R3Si group. Since attractive interligand Cl/R3Si contacts had already previously been invoked to explain the outcome of various ruthenium-catalyzed reactions, including trans-hydrosilylation, the experimental confirmation provided herein has implications beyond the present case.",

However, there is still a lack of a full understanding of the hydrated cation–π interactions between the hydrated cations and the aromatic ring structures on the molecular level. Here, we report a molecular picture of hydrated cation–π interactions, by using the calculations of density functional theory (DFT). Specifically, the graphene sheet can distort the hydration shell of the hydrated K+ to interact with K+ directly, which is hereafter called water–cation–π interactions. In contrast, the hydration shell of the hydrated Li+ is quite stable and the graphene sheet interacts with Li+ indirectly, mediated by water molecules, which we hereafter call the cation–water–π interactions. The behavior of hydrated cations adsorbed on a graphene surface is mainly attributed to the competition between the cation–π interactions and hydration effects. These findings provide valuable details of the structures and the adsorption energy of hydrated cations adsorbed onto the graphene surface.",

Combining experimental NIPE spectra and theoretical calculations, various Gly·X− complexes were found to adopt the same types of low-lying isomers, albeit with different relative energies. Despite more congested spectral profiles for Gly·Cl− and Gly·Br−, spectral assignments were accomplished with the guidance of the knowledge learned from Gly·I−, where a larger spin–orbit splitting of iodine afforded well-resolved, recognizable spectral peaks. Three canonical plus one zwitterionic isomer for Gly·Cl− and four canonical conformers for Gly·Br− were experimentally identified and characterized in contrast to the five canonical ones observed for Gly·I− under similar experimental conditions. Taken together, this study investigates both genericity and variations in binding patterns for the complexes composed of glycine and various halides, demonstrating that iodide-tagging is an effective spectroscopic means to unravel diverse ion-molecule binding motifs for cluster anions with congested spectral bands by substituting the respective ion with iodide.",

Here, we show a host-guest liquid gating mechanism to translate molecular interface recognition behavior into visually quantifiable detection signals. Quantitative chemical detection is achieved, which has obvious advantages for constructing a portable, affordable, on-site sensing platform to enable the visual quantitative testing of target molecules without optical/electrical equipment. Experiments and theoretical calculations confirm the specificity and scalability of the system. This mechanism can also be tailored by the rational design of host-guest complexes to quantitatively and visually detect various molecules. With the advantages of versatility and freedom from additional equipment, this detection mechanism has the potential to revolutionize environmental monitoring, food safety analysis, clinical drug testing, and more.",

We also investigate how the heterogeneous nucleation of butanol is affected by the seed size through comparing (NaCl)5, (NaCl)10, and (NaCl)25 seeds and by seed electrical charge through comparing (Na10Cl9)+, (NaCl)10, and (Na9Cl10)− seeds. Butanol is a common working fluid for condensation particle counters used in atmospheric aerosol studies, and NaCl seeds are frequently used for calibration purposes and as model systems, for example, sea spray aerosol. In general, our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed trends for the NaCl–BuOH–H2O system, such as the increase of nucleation rate with relative humidity and with temperature (at constant supersaturation of butanol). Our results also provide molecular-level insights into the vapor–seed interactions driving the first steps of the heterogeneous nucleation process. The main purpose of this work is to show that theoretical studies can provide molecular understanding of initial steps of heterogeneous nucleation and that it is possible to find cost-effective yet accurate-enough combinations of methods for configurational sampling and energy evaluation to successfully model heterogeneous nucleation of multicomponent systems. In the future, we anticipate that such simulations can also be extended to chemically more complex seeds.",

Natural bonding orbital and electron localization function disclosed that the negative charges are localized on the central atoms rather than the cages while the TME ionic bonding interactions increase in the order of Ge < Sn < Pb. The energy decomposition analysis revealed that the total bonding energy ∆Eint between central TM and E10 cage is above 150 kcal/mol. The ionic bonding interaction termed as electrostatic interaction ∆Eelstat increases in the order of Ge < Sn < Pb and becomes higher than the covalent bonding interactions termed as total orbital interactions ∆Eorb. Among the total orbital interactions, the π back donations from the TM–d orbitals to the empty cage orbitals consisting of E-p orbitals, the magnitude of which is importantly affected by the cage symmetry, are dominant contributions.",

The dominant adsorption conformations of HF/PF5/POF3 is analyzed according to Boltzmann distribution based on Gibbs free energy. The intermolecular interaction of these dominant conformation is revealed by the independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) method, which shows that the main driving force of adsorption is the hydrogen bond. After considering the thermodynamic correction, the adsorption free energy of fullerenols with HF turns from negative to positive at 95 °C, showing a transition between adsorption and desorption. The superior recovery characteristic is thus indicated. The Hirshfeld atomic charge shows that HF exhibit as an electron acceptor during the adsorption process. The charge transfer and density of states analysis illustrate the significant bonding effect that existed between fullerenol and gas. And the energy gap shows a decrease after adsorption, which results in an increase in conductivity. It can be deduced that fullerenol can transform the presence of the toxic fluoride gas into an electrical signal, and therefore exhibit a promising way as gas sensor for Li-ion battery status monitoring.",

The different stable conformations of probe C23 were found through theoretical method which can explain the negative experimental fluorescent character of the probe itself. The electron excitation analysis indicated the charge transfer process in the restricted probe C23 (binding to the hydrophobic cavity of HSA) and probe CS (C23 reaction with sulfite) when the molecules were under optical excitation. The theoretical results could be helpful for understanding the electronical properties in the probe and providing the insights for designing new functional probe molecules.",

Thus, taking the thermal synthesis of melamine as an example, this work finds a possible reaction path with Density Functional Theory (DFT) for forming melem during the thermal synthesis of g-C3N4. Combined with transition state theory (TST), it indicates that the formation of melem results from the condensation of melamine and isomerization of melam. Meanwhile, the weak signal near 2135 cm−1 in the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FTIR) corresponds to the vibration of carbodi-imines (–NCN–), which further proves the proposed reaction path. Thus, this work can explain the formation of g-C3N4 and its monomer, which may contribute to the successful formation of ideal g-C3N4 in the future.",

Herein, we presented a new tool, Bioactive Fractions Filtering Platform (BFFP), which is able to reliably discern active candidate node from crude extracts. The source code for the BFFP is available on GitHub (https://github.com/BioGavin/msbff). With the assistant of BFFP, 25 gabosine and chlorogentisyl alcohol derivatives including 19 new compounds were isolated from a marine-derived fungus Epicoccum sp. GST-5. Compounds 7, 9–15 possessed an unusual hybrid skeleton of gabosine and chlorogentisyl alcohol units. Compounds 9–12, 16 and 17 possessed a novel three-membered spiral ring skeleton with one/two gabosine and one/two chlorogentisyl alcohol units. Compound 25 represented new gabosine-derived skeleton possessing an unusual 6/6/6/5/6 condensed ring system. All isolates were evaluated for in vitro E. coli β-glucuronidase (EcGUS) inhibitory activity. 14 Compounds demonstrated superior inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.24–4.61 μM) to that of standard d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone (DSL, IC50 = 56.74 ± 4.01 μM). Compounds with chlorogentisyl alcohol moiety, such as 17 (IC50 = 0.24 ± 0.02 μM) and 1 (IC50 = 0.74 ± 0.03 μM), exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity. Furthermore, literature based QSAR profiling by applying PCA and OPLS analysis was carried out to analyze the features of compounds against EcGUS, revealing that the introduction of substituents able to form polar interactions with binding sites of receptor would lead to more active structures.",

            "abstract": "In the context of a project aiming at the replacement of the 3-substituted β-lactam ring in classical β-lactam antibiotics by an N(3)-acyl-1,3-diazetidinone moiety, we have investigated the reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes. Imines of aromatic aldehydes with anilines have been reported to react with acyl isocyanates to give 1,3-diazetidinones or 2,3-dihydro-4H-1,3,5-oxadiazin-4-ones, via [2+2] or [4+2] cycloaddition, respectively. However, neither of these products was formed with imines derived from allyl glycinate and 2-(mono)methyl propionaldehydes. α,α-Dimethylation of the imine enabled the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway, but the desired 1,3-diazetidinone products were not observed. Surprisingly, the imines obtained from thioesters of 2,2-dimethyl 3-oxo propionic acid reacted with aryl isocyanates or with benzyl isocyanate to give 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-6-(aryl-/alkylthio)tetrahydropyrimidines, via thiol displacement and re-addition to a putative six-membered iminium intermediate. These experimental results obtained for the reactions could be rationalized by DFT calculations. In addition, we have shown that N(3)-acyl-1,3-diazetidinone and 2,3-dihydro-4H-1,3,5-oxadiazin-4-one products can be distinguished based on experimental IR data in combination with theoretical reference spectra employing the IR spectra alignment (IRSA) algorithm. This discrimination was not possible by means of 1H, 13C, or 15N NMR spectroscopy",

The library of the compounds was set up in order to investigate the Bi⋯π arene interaction by systematic variation of X. The structural analysis in the solid state revealed that the triarylbismuth(III) compound 1 shows an encapsulation of the metal atom but the distances between the bismuth atom and the phenyl centroids amount to values close to or larger than 4.0 Å, which is considered to be a rather week dispersion interaction. In the case of monomeric diorganobismuth(III) compounds 2–5 the moderate crowding effectively hinders the formation of intermolecular donor–acceptor interactions, but allows for intramolecular dispersion-type interactions with the 2-biphenyl ligand. In contrast, the structures of the monoorganobismuth compounds 6–8 show the formation of Bi–X⋯Bi donor–acceptor bonds leading to the formation of 1D ribbons in the solid state. These coordination bonds are accompanied by intermolecular dispersion interactions with Bi⋯Phcentroid distances < 4.0 Å. In solution the diorganobismuth(III) halides 2–4 show a broadening of their NMR signals (H-8, H-8′ and H-9, H-9′ protons of the 2-biphenyl ligand), which is a result of dynamic processes including ligand rotation. For further elucidation of these processes compounds 2, 4 and 7 were studied by temperature-dependent NMR spectroscopy. Electronic structure calculations at the density functional theory and DLPNO-coupled cluster level of theory were applied to investigate and quantify the intramolecular London dispersion interactions, in an attempt to distinguish between basic intramolecular interactions and packing effects and to shed light on the dynamic behavior in solution.",

In this practice, rejuvenators are usually required to treat the oxidized asphalts with the aim to restore the physical properties and engineering performance. A critical function required for rejuvenators is that they can deagglomerate the asphaltene aggregates by effectively interacting with them. This study employed the techniques of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations, and investigated the impacts of oxidation on asphaltenes and the deagglomerating potential of three selected additives with different molecular structures and polarities, i.e., tributyl citrate (TBC), limonene, and myristamide. Analyses based on the aggregation number, orientational order parameter, and decomposition of the interaction energy indicated that oxidation strengthened the binding between the asphaltenes and thus promoted their aggregation behaviors. Among the three additives, TBC exhibited the highest rejuvenating effectiveness as it restrained the formation of large asphaltene aggregates and improved the orientational randomness of the aromatic cores. This capability was attributed to the highest number of polar sites in TBC and its three-dimensional spatial structure, which enhanced the compatibility and interactions with the aged asphaltenes. Based on the independent gradient model (IGM) method, the asphaltene aggregation is driven by the π-π interactions dominated by dispersion forces between the fused aromatic cores. The additives weakened the asphaltene interactions to different degrees, but the reversing effects were limited compared to the unaged state.",

Molecular-level cluster formation mechanisms are resolved, and theoretical results on particle formation are confirmed with mass spectrometer measurements. Trimethylamine oxide is capable of forming only one hydrogen bond with sulfuric acid, but unlike amines, trimethylamine oxide can form stable clusters via ion–dipole interactions. That is because of its zwitterionic structure, which causes a high dipole moment. Cluster growth occurs close to the acid:base ratio of 1:1, which is the same as for other monoprotic bases. Enhancement potential of trimethylamine oxide in particle formation is much higher than that of dimethylamine, but lower compared to guanidine. Therefore, at relatively low concentrations and high temperatures, guanidine and trimethylamine oxide may dominate particle formation events over amines.",

For this class of reactions, direct hydride transfer is the commonly accepted mechanism; however, an Alder–Ene-like pathway has been proposed as a plausible alternative. The reaction between 1,4-ditrimethylsilyl-1,4-dihydropyridine and α,β-unsaturated nitriles is a solid candidate for this latter pathway. In this work, we perform high level ab initio and density functional theory computations to characterize the mechanism of this reaction, taking into account diverse reaction paths, and evaluating the effect of solvent polarity and variations in the chemical structure. Our analysis explains the stereochemical aspects of the reaction, characterizing the up to now unresolved spatial configurations of the predominant products, and may contribute to the understanding of enzymatic reactions involving NADP(H). The reactions are found to proceed in an asynchronous fashion, with transition states that display significant aromatic features. With this observation in mind, Alder–Ene and direct hydride transfer pathways can be understood as two extremes of a continuous mechanistic spectrum for this kind of reaction, with the analyzed systems located approximately equidistant from both ends.",

            "abstract": "Conformationally flexible ancillary ligands have been widely used in transition metal catalysis. However, the benefits of using flexible ligands are often not well understood. We performed density functional theory (DFT) and experimental studies to elucidate the mechanisms and the roles of conformationally flexible α,α,α′,α′-tetraaryldioxolane-4,5-dimethanol (TADDOL)-derived ligands on the reactivity and selectivity in the Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration (CAHB) of alkenes. DFT calculations and deuterium labeling studies both indicated that the most favorable reaction pathway involves an unusual tertiary C–B bond reductive elimination to give high levels of regio- and enantioselectivities. Here, the asymmetric construction of the fully substituted carbon center is promoted by the flexibility of the TADDOL backbone, which leads to two ligand conformations with distinct steric environments in different steps of the catalytic cycle. A pseudo-chair ligand conformation is preferred in the rate-determining tertiary benzylic C–B reductive elimination. The less hindered steric environment with this conformation allows the benzylic group to bind to the Rh center in an η3 fashion, which stabilizes the C–B reductive elimination transition state. On the other hand, a pseudo-boat ligand conformation is involved in the selectivity-determining alkene migratory insertion step, where the more anisotropic steric environment leads to greater ligand–substrate steric interactions to control the π-facial selectivity. Thus, using a conformationally flexible ligand is beneficial for enhancing both reactivity and enantioselectivity by controlling ligand–substrate interactions in two different elementary steps.",

The system contains an electron-rich cavity with an adaptable shape, which can serve as a host for electron deficient guests, such as diquat, 10-methylacridinium, and anthraquinone. The new receptor forms inclusion complexes in the solid state and in solution, showing a dependence of the observed binding strength on the shape of the guest species and its charge. The interaction with the methylacridinium cation in solution was interpreted in terms of a 2:1 binding model, with K11 = 5.92(7) × 103 M–1. The solid receptor is porous to gases and vapors, yielding an uptake of ca. 4 mmol/g for methanol at 293 K. In solution, the receptor shows cyan fluorescence (λmaxem = 485 nm, ΦF = 33%), which is partly quenched upon binding of guests. Methylacridinium and anthraquinone adducts show red-shifted emission in the solid state, attributable to the charge-transfer character of these inclusion complexes.",

These compounds were fluorescent in solid films and in solutions with emission bands ranging from blue to green (445–517 nm). They showed a positive solvatochromism in the PL spectra, indicative of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the excited state. 1a, 1b, and 2 exhibited Aggregation-Induced Enhanced Emission (AIEE) characteristics with a drastic change in properties by increasing alkyl chains and donor alkoxy groups. Their carboxylate potassium salts had a blueshift emission compared to the acid carboxylic form and a significant quenching in PL intensity in protic polar solvents. The salt of 1a presented an Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE) profile, its weak fluorescence in water had an expressive enhancement by adding THF. Theoretical calculations were also carried out considering implicit solvent effects. The optimized structures of compounds and their simulated UV–vis absorption spectra showed no significant differences in water and acetonitrile. These results are in good agreement with the solvatochromism experiments. The calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gaps were 3.47 eV in both solvents, and the energy levels for HOMO and LUMO are slightly lower in water.",

            "abstract": "In order to control the explosiveness and shock sensitivity of XeO3, we have investigated its plausible interaction with various non-aromatic coordinating solvents, serving as potential Lewis base donors, through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Out of twenty six such solvents, the top ten were thus identified and then thoroughly examined by employing various computational tools such as the mapping of the electrostatic potential surface (MESP), Wiberg bond indices (WBIs), non-covalent interaction (NCI) plots, Bader's theory of atoms-in-molecules (AIM), natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, and the energy decomposition analysis (EDA). The amphoteric nature of XeO3 was also explored by investigating the extent of back donation from the lone pair of Xe to the antibonding orbital of the donating atom/group of the solvent molecules. The C−H…O interactions were also found to be a contributing factor in the stabilization of these adducts. Although these aerogen-bonding interactions were found to be predominantly electrostatic, significant contributions from the orbital contributions, as well as dispersion interactions, were observed. The top three non-aromatic solvents (among the twenty six studied) which form the strongest adducts with XeO3 are proposed to be hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), N,N′-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA).",

A chiral oxazaborolidine Lewis acid leads to a bathochromic absorption shift of the substrate and enables an efficient enantioface differentiation. Visible light irradiation (λ=450 nm) triggers the reaction which is tolerant of various groups at almost any position except carbon atom C8 (16 examples, 53–99 % yield, 80–97 % ee). Consecutive reactions were explored including a sensitized rearrangement to tetrahydrobiphenylenes, which occurred with full retention of configuration. Evidence was collected that the catalytic photocycloaddition occurs via triplet intermediates, and the binding mode of the acetonaphthone to the chiral Lewis acid was elucidated by DFT calculations.",

            "abstract": "Herein, a formal highly enantioselective organocatalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition of furanone derivatives and azomethine ylides is presented. The success of this reaction resides in intramolecular hydrogen bond activation through an o-hydroxy group at the aromatic ring of the imine, allowing the formation of highly multifunctional bicyclic adducts with five stereogenic centers in a stereocontrolled manner. Furthermore, the reaction is paired with a highly efficient kinetic resolution of butenolides, achieving selectivity factors above 200. Using this methodology, furan-2(5H)-ones and furo[3,4-c]pyrrolidinones were obtained with high enantioselectivities. Quantum chemistry calculations reveal the crucial role of the hydrogen bond formed between the catalyst donor-units and the two reactants, which modifies their arrangement and promotes effective facial discrimination resulting in a highly selective kinetic resolution. In addition, further applicability of the kinetic resolution process is shown.",

C-Glycosylation, in particular, has gained a flurry of recent attention. However, most reported methods are restricted to the relatively facile access to α-C-glycosides. Herein, we disclose a β-stereoselective glycosylation of indoles by employing a phosphonoselenide catalyst. The robustness of this protocol is exemplified by its amenability for reaction at both the indolyl C- and N- reactivity sites. In contrast to previous reports, in which the chalcogens were solely involved in Lewis acidic activation, our mechanistic investigation unraveled that the often neglected flanking aromatic substituents of phosphonoselenides can substantially contribute to catalysis by engaging in π-interactions. Computations and NMR spectroscopy indicated that the chalcogenic and aromatic components of the catalyst can be collectively exploited to foster conformational distortion of the glycal away from the usual half-chair to the boat conformation, which liberates the convex β-face for nucleophilic attack.",

Calculations at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVTZ level suggested significant differences in their conformational behavior, with DAE-w exhibiting 22 unique conformers and DAS-w featuring three stable structures within 6 kJ mol−1. However, only transitions from the lowest energy conformer of each were experimentally observed. Spectral analysis confirmed that binding with water does not alter the conformational preference for the lowest energy structure of the monomers, but it does influence the relative stabilities of all other conformers, particularly in the case of DAE. Non-covalent interaction and quantum theory of atoms in molecules analyses showed that the observed conformer for each complex is stabilized by two intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs), where water primarily interacts with the central oxygen or sulfur atom of the diallyl compounds, along with secondary interactions involving the allyl groups. The nature of these interactions was further elucidated using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory, which suggests that the primary HB interaction with S in DAS is weaker and more dispersive in nature compared to the primary HB in DAE. This supports the experimental observation of a tunneling splitting exclusively in the rotational spectrum of DAS-w, as the weaker contact allows water to undergo internal motions within the complex, as shown based on calculated transition state structures for possible tunneling pathways.",

The possibility of determining rate constants for cations independently of each other makes it possible to observe the kinetic effect of separation. The extraction rate was found to be lower for the bipyridyl ligand, compared to phenanthroline. The values of the rotation barriers for the ligands were calculated using the DFT method. The values correlate with the obtained low extraction rate for the bipyridyl ligand. Also, crystallographic data showing anti-conformation for the bipyridyl ligand align with the kinetic data. Surface tension was also determined for the systems with the studied ligands. It is shown that at equal ligand concentrations, the value of surface tension agrees with the extraction rate. Furthermore, it is shown that for the bipyridyl ligand, prior contact of the organic phase with nitric acid significantly affects the surface tension.",

            "abstract": "The bifunctional spin label double-histidine copper-(II) capped with nitrilotriacetate [dHis-Cu(II)-NTA], used in conjunction with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods can provide high-resolution distance data for investigating protein structure and backbone conformational diversity. Quantitative utilization of this data is limited due to a lack of rapid and accurate dHis-Cu(II)-NTA modeling methods that can be used to translate experimental data into modeling restraints. Here, we develop two dHis-Cu(II)-NTA rotamer libraries using a set of recently published molecular dynamics simulations and a semi-empirical meta-dynamics-based conformational ensemble sampling tool for use with the recently developed chiLife bifunctional spin label modeling method. The accuracy of both the libraries and the modeling method are tested by comparing model predictions to experimentally determined distance distributions. We show that this method is accurate with absolute deviation between the predicted and experimental modes between 0.0–1.2 Å with an average of 0.6 Å over the test data used. In doing so, we also validate the generality of the chiLife bifunctional label modeling method. Taken together, the increased structural resolution and modeling accuracy of dHis-Cu(II)-NTA over other spin labels promise improvements in the accuracy and resolution of protein models by EPR.",

Herein, the interaction of flavin derivatives including substituted flavins (isoalloxazines), 1,10-ethylene-bridged flavinium salts, and non-substituted alloxazine and deazaflavin with selected nucleophiles was investigated using an experimental and computational approach. Triphenylphosphine or trimethylphosphine, 1-nitroethan-1-ide, and methoxide were selected as representatives of neutral soft, anionic soft, and hard nucleophiles, respectively. The interactions were investigated using UV/Vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy as well as by DFT calculations. The position of nucleophilic attack estimated using the calculated Gibbs free energy values was found to correspond with the experimental data, favouring the addition of phosphine and 1-nitroethan-1-ide into position N(5) and methoxide into position C(10a) of 1,10-ethylene-bridged flavinium salts. The calculated Gibbs free energy values were found to correlate with the experimental redox potentials of the flavin derivatives tested. These findings can be utilized as valuable tools for the design of artificial flavin-based catalytic systems or investigating the mechanism of flavoenzymes.",

Protonation of the pyridine unit results in a greatly enhanced preference for nesting in the cavity of the highly bent teropyrene system (θcalc=162.6°) and emergence of a charge transfer absorption band (λmax=592 nm) due to a long range (5.0–5.5 Å), through-space intramolecular transition between the teropyrene and pyridinium units, which does not exist in the neutral cyclophane.",

The conformational flexibility of these systems is one of their key properties and requires a cost-effective methodology to be studied by combining the accuracy of results with the possibility of exploring a large set of conformations. In the present paper, we have explored the conformational potential energy surface of the monomers and dimers of α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins (i.e., 6, 7, and 8 monomeric units, respectively) by means of fast but accurate semiempirical methods, which are then refined by state-of-the-art DFT functionals. Moreover, the crystal structure is considered for a more suitable comparison with the IR spectrum experimentally recorded. Calculations are carried out in the gas phase and in water environments, applying both implicit and explicit treatments. We show that the conformation of the studied molecules changes from the gas phase to the water, even if treated implicitly, thus modifying their complexation capability.",

The only clinically approved GR antagonist lacks selectivity and induces unwanted side effects. To complement existing tools of small-molecule-based inhibitors, we present a highly potent, catalytically-driven GR degrader, KH-103, based on proteolysis-targeting chimera technology. This selective degrader enables immediate and reversible GR depletion that is independent of genetic manipulation and circumvents transcriptional adaptations to inhibition. KH-103 achieves passive inhibition, preventing agonistic induction of gene expression, and significantly averts the GR’s genomic effects compared to two currently available inhibitors. Application in primary-neuron cultures revealed the dependency of a glucocorticoid-induced increase in spontaneous calcium activity on GR. Finally, we present a proof of concept for application in vivo. KH-103 opens opportunities for a more lucid interpretation of GR functions with translational potential.",

In particular, the presence of diffuse interstellar bands and their association with C60+ has led to the hypothesis that hydrogenated derivatives, known as fulleranes, may also exist in the interstellar medium and contribute to these bands. In this study, we systematically investigated the structural and spectroscopic properties of C60Hn+q (n = 0–4, q = 0,1) using an automated global minimum search and density functional theory calculations. Our results revealed novel global minimum structures for C60H2 and C60H4, distinct from previous reports. Notably, all hydrogenated fullerenes exhibited lower ionization potentials and higher proton affinities compared to C60. From an astrochemical perspective, our results exposed the challenges in establishing definitive spectroscopic criteria for detecting fulleranes using mid-infrared and UV-Vis spectroscopies. However, we successfully identified distinct electronic transitions in the near-infrared range that serve as distinctive signatures of cationic fulleranes. We strongly advocate for further high-resolution experimental studies to fully explore the potential of these transitions for the interstellar detection of fulleranes.",

The results reveal that the concerted tunneling motion of the hydrogen atoms leads to the inversion of the sign of the dipole moment components along the a and b principal axes, due to the interchange motion that cooperatively breaks and reforms one intermolecular hydrogen bond. This motion is also coupled with two acceptor switching motions. The energy difference between the two ground vibrational states arising from this tunneling motion was determined to be 29.003(2) MHz. The corresponding wavefunctions suggest that the two hydrogen atoms are evenly delocalized on two equivalent potential wells, which differs from the heterochiral case where the hydrogen atoms are confined in separate wells, as the permutation-inversion symmetry breaks down. This intriguing contrast in hydrogen-atom behavior between homochiral and heterochiral environments could further illuminate our understanding of the role of chirality in intermolecular interactions and dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Interfacial interactions of protonated water clusters adsorbed at aromatic surfaces play an important role in biology, and in atmospheric, chemical and materials sciences. Here, we investigate the interaction of protonated water clusters ((H+H2O)n (where n=1–3)) with benzene (Bz), coronene (Cor) and dodecabenzocoronene (Dbc)). To study the structure, stability and spectral features of these complexes, computations are done using DFT-PBE0(+D3) and SAPT0 methods. These interactions are probed by AIM electron density topography and non-covalent interactions index (NCI) analyses. We suggest that the excess proton plays a crucial role in the stability of these model interfaces through strong inductive effects and the formation of Eigen or Zundel features. Also, computations reveal that the extension of the π-aromatic system and the increase of the number of water molecules in the H-bounded water network led to a strengthening of the interactions between the corresponding aromatic compound and protonated water molecules, except when a Zundel ion is formed. The present findings may serve to understand in-depth the role of proton localized at aqueous medium interacting with large aromatic surfaces such as graphene interacting with acidic liquid water. Besides, we give the IR and UV-Vis spectra of these complexes, which may help for their identification in laboratory.",

Their planar structures and partial relative configurations have been determined by careful interpretation of their spectroscopic data. The full assignment of the relative and absolute configurations of tolypyridones I–M was achieved by gauge-independent atomic orbital 13C NMR calculation, quantitative nuclear Overhauser effects based interatomic distance calculation, and electronic circular dichroism calculation. In addition, we have fully determined the configuration of tolypyridone A by X-ray diffraction analysis. In bioassay, tolypyridones I was able to restore cell viability and inhibit the release of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase for ethanol-induced LO2 cells, suggesting its potential as a liver protective agent.",

For the photoresist systems consisting of copolymers of HFASt/another p-substituted St and a sulfonium salt-type PAG, solubility tests for coating films in the alkaline developer and proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and theoretical calculations for mixtures of the monomers and PAG were performed. It was found that p-substituted St monomers with a highly polar functional group and an electron-dense aromatic ring were effective in the dissolution inhibition. Since the interaction between p-substituted St monomers and the cationic part of PAG was well predictable and quantifiable with theoretical calculations, which was consist well with the experimental data, the study method adopted in this study enables rational structural design of the polymers/PAG system that exhibits a high dissolution inhibition effect, which can lead to the development of non-chemically amplified positive tone-type resist materials usable for the formation of high-resolution patterns.",

It was found that in acidic acetonitrile solutions the pH range of dominating the doubly protonated form depends on the nature of the substituent in the para-position of the phenyl fragment on the periphery of the porphyrin ring: electron-donor substituents expand the pH range of dominating the porphyrin dication, whereas electron-acceptor substituents decrease it. The calculation of the energies of the molecular orbitals of the studied compounds by the DFT method with the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ set showed good agreement between the experiment and the calculations.",

This study explores the enhancing effect of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) on the aqueous solubility of curcumin (CUR) via experiment and theoretical calculation. Choline chloride-based DESs with polyols 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO), 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol as hydrogen bond donors were prepared and used as co-solvents. The CUR aqueous solubility increased with increasing the DESs content at temperature of 303.15–318.15 K, especially in aqueous ChCl/1,2-PDO (mole ratio 1:4) solutions. The positive apparent molar volume values and reduced density gradient analysis confirmed the existence of strong interactions between CUR and solvent. The van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding coexisted in DESs monomer retained the stability of DESs structure after introducing CUR. Moreover, the lower interaction energy of DESs⋅⋅⋅CUR system than that of the counterpart DESs further proved the strong interaction between CUR and DESs. The lowest interaction energy of ChCl/1,2-PDO⋅⋅⋅CUR system indicated that this system was the most stable and ChCl/1,2-PDO was promising for CUR dissolution. This work provides efficient solvents for utilizing curcumin, contributing to a deep insight into the interactions between DES and CUR at the molecular level, and the role of DESs on enhancing drugs solubility.",

The latter predicted highly competitive equilibria for both species, including 14 unique conformers of AEE and 12 for the sulfur analog AES within 14 kJ mol−1. The experimental rotational spectrum of AEE was dominated by transitions arising from its three lowest energy conformers, which differ in the arrangement of the allyl side chain, while in AES, transitions due to the two most stable forms, distinct in the orientation of the ethyl group, were observed. Splitting patterns attributed to methyl internal rotation were analyzed for AEE conformers I and II, and the corresponding V3 barriers were determined to be 12.172(55) and 12.373(32) kJ mol−1, respectively. The experimental ground state geometries of both AEE and AES were derived using the observed rotational spectra of the 13C and 34S isotopic species and are highly dependent on the electronic properties of the linking chalcogen (oxygen vs sulfur). The observed structures are consistent with a decrease in hybridization in the bridging atom from oxygen to sulfur. The molecular-level phenomena that drive the conformational preferences are rationalized through natural bond orbital and non-covalent interaction analyses. These show that interactions involving the lone pairs on the chalcogen atom with the organic side chains favor distinct geometries and energy orderings for the conformers of AEE and AES.",

Flotation experiments were conducted with chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite after treatment with SA and/or potassium permanganate, and the possible complexes formed by SA on the mineral surface were theoretically analyzed. SA was more easily adsorbed on the arsenopyrite surface after potassium permanganate pretreatment. The maximum depressant effect of arsenopyrite was observed following treatment with 62.5 mg/L of potassium permanganate and 1000 mg/L of SA with flotation at pH 11. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the adsorption of SA on the chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite surfaces was dominated by chemisorption. Theoretical analyses confirmed that the adsorption strength of SA on the arsenopyrite surface was higher than that on chalcopyrite. Furthermore, the intermolecular interactions between SA and the possible complexes formed were investigated using interaction region indicator function tools. The results of this investigation revealed that SA adsorption on chalcopyrite and arsenopyrite surfaces is controlled by partial covalent hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions. Therefore, SA can be used as a promising green depressant for the separation of arsenopyrite during chalcopyrite flotation.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogen bonding interactions are essential in the structural stabilization and physicochemical properties of complex molecular systems, and carboxylic acid functional groups are common participants in these motifs. Consequently, the neutral formic acid (FA) dimer has been extensively investigated in the past, as it represents a useful model system to investigate proton donor–acceptor interactions. The analogous deprotonated dimers, in which two carboxylate groups are bound by a single proton, have also served as informative model systems. In these complexes, the position of the shared proton is mainly determined by the proton affinity of the carboxylate units. However, very little is known about the nature of the hydrogen bonding interactions in systems containing more than two carboxylate units. Here we report a study on the deprotonated (anionic) FA trimer. IR spectra are recorded in the 400–2000 cm−1 spectral range by means of vibrational action spectroscopy of FA trimer ions embedded in helium nanodroplets. Characterization of the gas-phase conformer and assignment of the vibrational features is achieved by comparing the experimental results with electronic structure calculations. To assist in the assignments, the 2H and 18O FA trimer anion isotopologues are also measured under the same experimental conditions. Comparison between the experimental and computed spectra, especially the observed shifts in spectral line positions upon isotopic substitution of the exchangeable protons, suggests that the prevalent conformer, under the experimental conditions, exhibits a planar structure that resembles the crystalline structure of formic acid.",

            "abstract": "A class of adamantane-like molecular materials attracts attention because they exhibit an extreme non-linear optical response and emit a broad white-light spectrum after illumination with a continuous-wave infrared laser source. According to recent studies, not only the nature of the cluster molecules, but also the macroscopic structure of the materials determines their non-linear optical properties. Here we present a systematic study of cluster dimers of the compounds AdR4 and [(RT)4S6] (T = Si, Ge, Sn) with R = methyl, phenyl or 1-naphthyl to gain fundamental knowledge about the interactions in the materials. For all compounds, a similar type of dimer structures with a staggered arrangement of substituents was determined as the energetically most favorable configuration. The binding energy between the dimers, determined by including London dispersion interactions, increases with the size of the core and the substituents. The cluster interactions can be classified as substituent-substituent-dominated (small cores, large substituents) or core–core-dominated (large cores, small substituents). Among various possible dimer conformers, those with small core–core distances are energetically preferred. Trimer and tetramer clusters display similar trends regarding the minimal core–core distances and binding energies. The much lower energy barrier determined for the rotation of substituents as compared to the rotation of the cluster dimers past each other indicates that the rotation of substituents more easily leads to different conformers in the material. Thus, understanding the interaction of the cluster dimers allows an initial assessment of the interactions in the materials.",

            "abstract": "Fatty acids are an abundant class of lipids that are characterised by wide structural variation including isomeric diversity arising from the position and configuration of functional groups. Traditional approaches to fatty acid characterisation have combined chromatography and mass spectrometry for a description of the composition of individual fatty acids while infrared (IR) spectroscopy has provided insights into the functional groups and bond configurations at the bulk level. Here we exploit universal 3-pyridylcarbinol ester derivatization of fatty acids to acquire IR spectra of individual lipids as mass-selected gas-phase ions. Intramolecular interactions between the protonated pyridine moiety and carbon–carbon double bonds present highly sensitive probes for regiochemistry and configuration through promotion of strong and predictable shifts in IR resonances. Gas-phase IR spectra obtained from unsaturated fatty acids are shown to discriminate between isomers and enable the first unambiguous structural assignment of 6Z-octadecenoic acid in human-derived cell lines. Compatibility of 3-pyridylcarbinol ester derivatization with conventional chromatography-mass spectrometry and now gas-phase IR spectroscopy paves the way for comprehensive structure elucidation of fatty acids that is sensitive to regio- and stereochemical variations and with the potential to uncover new pathways in lipid metabolism.",

            "abstract": "Iodine can be considered as the simplest halogen-bond donor. Previous investigations have revealed its remarkable catalytic effect in various reactions. The catalytic activity of iodine can often even compete with that of traditional Lewis acids. So far, iodine was typically used to activate carbonyl derivatives like Michael acceptors. We now demonstrate that iodine can also be used to activate allyl aryl ethers in Claisen rearrangements. The formed ortho-allylic phenols rapidly undergo iodocyclizations to afford dihydrobenzofurans, which are important building blocks for medicinal applications. A comparison with different catalysts further highlights the potential of iodine catalysis for this reaction. Computational and mechanistic investigations provide deeper insights into the underlying non-covalent interactions and their role for the catalysis.",

            "abstract": "Acrylic acid is an important basic chemical and a key starting compound for a variety of consumer products. Today, acrylic acid is still produced from fossil-based propene. If acrylic acid were produced from bio-based lactic acid, this would be an important step towards sustainability. The gas-phase dehydration reaction of lactic acid to acrylic acid was performed over eight-membered ring PHI-type zeolites in the Na+ and K+-form. A few variations in the synthesis procedure of PHI-type zeolite made a big difference in the performance during the catalytic reaction due to differences in the physical and chemical properties, especially the accessibility of the pores. The catalysts were characterized with ICP-OES, XRD, CO2 physisorption, SEM and 27Al MAS NMR. The calcination resulted in a partial collapse of the PHI structure. In the case of Na,K-PHI with a low surface area, the catalysis tends to take place on the outer surface, while in the case of Na,K-PHI with a high surface area the catalysis can also take place within the pore system. This has a considerable influence on the selectivity of the catalysts.",

            "abstract": "The biopharmaceutical classification system groups low-solubility drugs into two groups: II and IV, with high and low permeability, respectively. Most of the new drugs developed for common pathologies present solubility issues. This is the case of lurasidone hydrochloride—a drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Likewise, the stability problems of some drugs limit the possibility of preparing them in liquid pharmaceutical forms where hydrolysis and oxidation reactions can be favored. Lurasidone hydrochloride presents the isoindole-1,3-dione ring, which is highly susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis, and the benzisothiazole ring, which is susceptible to a lesser extent to oxidation. Herein, we propose to study the increase in the solubility and stability of lurasidone hydrochloride by the formation of higher-order inclusion complexes with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. Several stoichiometric relationships were studied at between 0.5 and 3 hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin molecules per drug molecule. The obtained products were characterized, and their solubility and stability were assessed. According to the obtained results, the formation of inclusion complexes dramatically increased the solubility of the drug, and this increased with the increase in the inclusion ratio. This was associated with the loss of crystalline state of the drug, which was in an amorphous state according to infrared spectroscopy, calorimetry, and X-ray analysis. This was also correlated with the stabilization of lurasidone by the cyclodextrin inhibiting its recrystallization. Phase solubility,1H-NMR, and docking computational characterization suggested that the main stoichiometric ratio was 1:1; however, we cannot rule out a 1:2 ratio, where a second cyclodextrin molecule could bind through the isoindole-1,3-dione ring, improving its stability as well. Finally, we can conclude that the formation of higher-order inclusion complexes of lurasidone with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin is a successful strategy to increase the solubility and stability of the drug.",

            "abstract": "Porous metal–organic framework [Zn2(ttdc)2(bpy)] (1) based on thieno [3,2-b]thiophenedicarboxylate (ttdc) was synthesized and characterized. The structure contains intersected zig-zag channels with an average aperture of 4 × 6 Å and a 49% (v/v) guest-accessible pore volume. Gas adsorption studies confirmed the microporous nature of 1 with a specific surface area (BET model) of 952 m2·g–1 and a pore volume of 0.37 cm3·g–1. Extensive CO2, N2, O2, CO, CH4, C2H2, C2H4 and C2H6 gas adsorption experiments at 273 K and 298 K were carried out, which revealed the great adsorption selectivity of C2H6 over CH4 (IAST selectivity factor 14.8 at 298 K). The sulfur-rich ligands and double framework interpenetration in 1 result in a dense decoration of the inner surface by thiophene heterocyclic moieties, which are known to be effective secondary adsorption sites for carbon dioxide. As a result, remarkable CO2 adsorption selectivities were obtained for CO2/CH4 (11.7) and CO2/N2 (27.2 for CO2:N2 = 1:1, 56.4 for CO2:N2 = 15:85 gas mixtures). The computational DFT calculations revealed the decisive role of the sulfur-containing heterocycle moieties in the adsorption of CO2 and C2H6. High CO2 adsorption selectivity values and a relatively low isosteric heat of CO2 adsorption (31.4 kJ·mol–1) make the porous material 1 a promising candidate for practical separation of biogas as well as for CO2 sequestration from flue gas or natural gas.",

The reported compounds make use of light-responsive molecular actuators consisting of an azobenzene attached to a bithiophene unit by both direct and linker-assisted bonding. Upon exposure to 350 nm light, the azobenzene undergoes trans-to-cis isomerization, thus mechanically inducing the oligothiophene to assume a planar conformation (extended π-conjugation). Exposure to 254 nm wavelength promotes azobenzene cis-to-trans isomerization, forcing the thiophenic backbones to twist out of planarity (confined π-conjugation). Twisted conformations are also reached by cis-to-trans thermal relaxation at a rate that increases proportionally with the conjugation length of the oligothiophene moiety. The molecular conformations of quaterthiophene and sexithiophene were characterized by using steady-state UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography and quantum-chemical modeling. Finally, we tested the proposed light-responsive oligothiophenes in field-effect transistors to probe the photo-induced tuning of their electronic properties.",

Improvements in solvent design for SED require a fundamental understanding of the molecular interactions governing solvation behavior. Herein, quantum chemical calculations are used to delineate different fundamental interactions in water-solvent systems involving 38 different solvents, with a particular focus on the role of the electrostatic potential characteristics. These interactions are rigorously analyzed using the independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH), Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT), as well as the energy decomposition analysis based on force field (EDA-FF) to compare against a standard force field model. The solvation free energies and partition coefficients are also calculated to estimate water extraction performance in a bulk solvent system.",

Compound 8 was the first example that was isolated from the rhizomes of Menispermum dauricum, benzylisoquinoline and an aromatic unit connected by a sugar bridge. Compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on the dopamine D1 receptor. Compounds 1, 8, 21, 24 and 29 showed potent D1 antagonistic activities, with IC50 values ranging from 1.0 to 4.5 μM. Compound 1 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity with an IC50 value of 1.0 ± 0.2 μM.",

The switch in the torquoselectivity is controlled by the nature of the Lewis acid used as promoter. From the four possible stereoisomers, only the two trans were observed. The Lewis acids employed were achiral and the diastereoselectivities were dictated by the sulfinyl auxiliary. Density functional theory investigations shed light on the reaction mechanism. The experimental torquoselectivities were very closely reproduced and their inversion could be linked back to a change in the binding mode of the substrate.",

Modeling the equilibrium of different ligand coordination, it was predicted that strong sigma donor molecules would be required to displace N2H4. Monitoring competition experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed that trimethyl phosphine oxide, dimethylformamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide displaced N2H4 in large or small lanthanide complexes.",

Herein, we report the skeletal editing of indoles through nitrogen atom insertion, accessing the corresponding quinazoline or quinoxaline bioisosteres by trapping of an electrophilic nitrene species generated from ammonium carbamate and hypervalent iodine. This reactivity relies on the strategic use of a silyl group as a labile protecting group that can facilitate subsequent product release. The utility of this highly functional group-compatible methodology in the context of late-stage skeletal editing of several commercial drugs is demonstrated.",

In the competitive solvent mixture 1 : 1 CDCl3 : CD3OD, one of the receptors exhibits a much higher selectivity preference for chloride than an analogous rotaxane without the hydroxy groups. X-ray crystal structures reveal the chloride anion guest encapsulated within the interlocked binding cavity, though not all of the hydrogen bond donors are utilised. Computational semi-empirical simulations indicate that secondary intermolecular interactions occur between the axle hydroxy hydrogen bond donors and the [2]rotaxane macrocycle components, contributing to a more preorganised binding pocket, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced selectivity.",

The smoothed molar thermodynamic functions in the condensed state were determined on the basis of these measurements. The thermodynamic functions of the formation were also calculated. The gas-phase entropy at 298.15 K was obtained using the entropy of crystal 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, entropy of fusion and entropy of vaporization. This entropy value was used to clarify some aspects of the discrepancies between the interpretations of pseudorotation in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. An extended quantum chemical study of pseudorotation in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran was undertaken to provide additional insight into the conformational features of a molecule. The contribution of pseudorotation to the entropy was calculated for different pseudorotational potentials constructed using various theoretical models. The experimental entropy value is in best agreement with intramolecular conversion between two low energy conformers connected by the transition state with an energy of about 4 kJ mol−1. The standard thermodynamic properties of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran in the gaseous state (T = 100 K to 1500 K) were calculated using experimental and theoretical molecular parameters.",

This was confirmed by rotational spectroscopy as only transitions corresponding to the global minimum of DAS were observed while the spectrum of DAE was much richer and composed of features from the nine lowest energy conformers. To understand the effects that govern the conformational preferences of DAE and DAS, natural bond orbital and non-covalent interaction analyses were done. These show that unique orbital interactions stabilize several conformers of the ether making its conformational landscape more competitive than that of the sulfide. This is consistent with a bonding model involving decreased hybridization of the bridging atom as one moves down the periodic table which is confirmed by the experimental ground state structures of the lowest energy forms of DAE and DAS, derived using spectra of the 13C and 34S substituted species in natural abundance.",

These properties are currently not met by the latest generation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. Here, we present an approach, called “hot exciplexes” that enables access to both attributes at the same time. Hot exciplexes are produced by coupling facing donor and acceptor moieties to an anthracene bridge, yielding an exciplex with large T1 to T2 spacing. The hot exciplex model is investigated using optical spectroscopy and quantum chemical simulations. Reverse intersystem crossing is found to occur preferentially from the T3 to the S1 state within only a few nanoseconds. Application and practicality of the model are shown by fabrication of organic light-emitting diodes with up to 32 % hot exciplex contribution and low efficiency roll-off.",

As found experimentally and validated through computational modeling, PFPBNT exhibits aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behavior, broad absorption in the UV–vis spectrum and significant Stokes shift (≈4632 cm–1), thereby making it an excellent candidate as luminophore in thin-film LSCs based on a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix, where it is found to show good compatibility, homogeneous distribution, and excellent photostability. After extensive device optimization, PFPBNT/PMMA LSCs with suitable luminophore concentration (12.5 wt%) showed an internal photon efficiency of 17.3% at a geometrical gain of 6.25 under solar-simulated illumination. The size scalability of these systems was also evaluated by means of ray-tracing simulations on devices of up to 1 m2 surface area. This work demonstrates semi-transparent large-area thin-film LSCs incorporating chemically sustainable AIEgen luminophores, thus opening the way to the development of synthetically affordable, efficient, and stable emitters for the photovoltaic field.",

The observed patterns of transitions are consistent with the most stable geometries of the TMO–w, TMO–(w)2, and TMS–w complexes at the B2PLYP-D3(BJ)/aug-cc-pVTZ level and were confirmed using spectra of the 18O isotopologue. Due to its effectively planar backbone, TMO offers one unique binding site for solvation, while water can bind to the puckered TMS ring in either an axial or equatorial site of the heteroatom. In all clusters, the first water molecule binds in the σv symmetry plane of the ring monomer and serves as a hydrogen bond donor to the heteroatom. The second water molecule is predicted to form a cooperative hydrogen bonding network between the three moieties. Secondary C–H⋯O interactions are a key stabilizing influence in trimers and also drive the preferred binding site in the TMS clusters with the axial binding site preferred in TMS–w and the equatorial form calculated to be more stable in the dihydrate. Using an energy partition scheme from the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory for the O, S, and Se containing mono- and dihydrates, the intermolecular interactions are revealed to be mainly electrostatic, but the dispersive character of the contacts is enhanced with the increasing size of the ring’s heteroatom due to the key role of longer-range secondary interactions.",

From a total of nine possible energy minima within 10 kJ mol−1, transitions for the two most stable conformers of AMA–w were detected, and assigned aided by DFT and ab initio MP2 predictions. The observed rotational transitions displayed characteristic hyperfine splittings due to the presence of the 14N quadrupolar nucleus. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), non-covalent interaction (NCI) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analyses showed that the observed conformers of AMA–w are stabilized by two intermolecular interactions consisting of a dominant N⋯H–O and a secondary C–H⋯O hydrogen bond (HB) in which the water molecule acts simultaneously as a HB donor and acceptor. The HBs formed with water do not change the relative energy ordering of the most stable conformers of AMA but do affect the stability of higher energy conformations by disrupting the intramolecular forces responsible for their geometries. By comparing the intermolecular interaction energies with those of the monohydrates of the simplest primary (methylamine, MA), secondary (dimethylamine, DMA) and tertiary (trimethylamine, TMA) amines using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) calculations, we find that AMA forms the strongest bound complex with water. This is rationalized through the identification of subtle differences in stabilizing and destabilizing contributions across the amine–w series of complexes.",

The thermal energy available at room temperature typically equilibrates the accessible conformational states. Here, we introduce a method for isolating unique and previously understudied conformations of macrocycles. The observation of unusual conformations of 16- to 22-membered rings has been made possible by controlling their interconversion using dominant rotors, which represent tunable atropisomeric constituents with relatively high rotational barriers. Density functional theory and in situ NMR measurements suggest that dominant rotor candidates for the amino-acid-based structures considered here should possess a rotational energy barrier of at least 25 kcal mol−1. Notable differences in the geometries of the macrocycle conformations were identified by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. There is evidence that amino acid residues can be forced into rare turn motifs not observed in the corresponding linear counterparts and homodetic rings. These findings should unlock new avenues for studying the conformation–activity relationships of bioactive molecules.",

            "abstract": "Tailored synthesis of nanographenes, and especially graphene nanoribbons (GNR), has been achieved on metal substrates via a bottom-up approach from organic precursors, which paves the way to their application in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics. Since quantum confinement in nanographenes leads to the creation of peculiar band structures, strongly influenced by their topological characteristics, it is important to be able to exactly engineer them in order to precisely tune their electronic, optical and magnetic properties. However practical application of these materials requires post-synthesis transfer to insulating substrates. Recently, cyclodehydrofluorination of fluorinated organic precursors has been shown to be a promising pathway to achieve metal-free bottom-up synthesis of nanographenes. Here we present how to apply in situ laser annealing to induce cyclodehydrofluorination leading to nanographene formation directly on non-metallic surfaces. In this work, we analyze the changes in the Raman fingerprint of the fluorinated precursor tetrafluoro-diphenyl-quinquephenyl (TDQ) during the laser annealing process in high vacuum (HV), demonstrating that both heating and photo-induced processes influence the cyclization process. Hence, in situ laser annealing allows not only to influence chemical reactions, but also to have a fast and contact-free monitoring of the reaction products. Optimization of the laser annealing process adds a new level of control in the tailored synthesis of nanographenes on non-metallic substrates. This is a very promising pathway to unravel the full application potential of nanographenes in general and GNR in particular, enabling a fast optimization of precursor molecules and substrate geometry engineered for specific applications.",

In addition, the pH-modulating abilities of specific carbonic anhydrase isoforms played a crucial role in different models of inflammation and neuropathic pain. Herein, we report a series of chemical hybrids consisting of a Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) inhibitor linked to a CO-RM tail (CAI/CO-RMs). All compounds and their precursors were first tested in vitro for their inhibition activity against the human CA I, II, IX, and XII isoforms as well their CO releasing properties, aiming at corroborating the data by means of molecular modelling techniques. Then, their impact on metabolic activity modulation of RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages for 24 and 48 h was assessed with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. The compounds were shown to counteract the inflammatory stimulus as also indicated by the reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) release after treatment. All the biological results were compared to those of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as a reference antioxidant compound. Within the series, two CAI/CO-RM hybrids (1 and 2), bearing both the well-known scaffold able to inhibit CAs (acesulfame) and the cobalt-based CO releasing portion, induced a higher anti-inflammatory effect up to 48 h at concentrations lower than NAC.",

Intramolecular interactions are preferably found in the gas phase. DFT calculations with and without dispersion correction show larger interacting aromatic groups increase the stabilization energy of folded conformers and decrease the intermolecular centroid–centroid distance. Single-molecule structures generally adopt folded conformations with short intramolecular aryl–aryl contacts. Gas electron diffraction experiments were performed exemplarily for 1-(pentafluorophenoxy)-2-(phenoxy)ethane. A new procedure for structure refinement was developed to deal with the conformational complexity of such molecules. The results are an experimental confirmation of the existence of folded conformations of this molecule with short intramolecular aryl–aryl distances in the gas phase. Solid-state structures are dominated by stretched structures without intramolecular aryl–aryl interactions but interactions with neighboring molecules.",

            "abstract": "Four cobalt(III)–phenylalanine complexes, [Co(Phe)(py2en)](ClO4)2·H2O (1), [Co(Phe)(TPA)](ClO4)2·H2O (2), [Co(Phe)(py2enMe2)](ClO4)2·H2O (3) and [Co(bipy)2(Phe)](ClO4)2·H2O (4), were investigated as prototype models for hypoxia-activated delivery of melphalan – a phenylalanine derivative anticancer drug of the class of nitrogen mustards. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis provided the molecular structures of 1–4, as a single isomer/conformer. According with NMR and theoretical calculations, the solid-state structures of 2 and 4 are maintained in solutions. For complexes 1 and 3, though, a mixture of isomers was found in DMSO solutions: Λ-cisα(exo,exo) and Δ-cisβ1(exo,exo) for 1 (3 : 2 ratio), and Λ-cisα(exo,exo) and Δ-cisα(exo,exo) for 3 (5 : 1 ratio). Theoretical calculations point to a re-equilibration reaction of the solid-state Λ-cisβ1 isomer of 1 in solution. Electrochemical analysis revealed a correlation between the electron-donor capacity of the ancillary ligands and the redox potentials of the complexes. The potentials varied from +0.01 for 1 to +0.31 V vs. SHE for 4 in aqueous media and indicate that reduction should be achieved in biological media. The integrity of the complexes in pH 5.5 and 7.4 buffered solutions was confirmed by UV-Vis monitoring up to 24 h at 25 °C. Reduction by ascorbic acid (AA) shows an O2-dependent dissociation of the L-Phe for complexes 1–3, with higher conversion rates at pH 7.4. For complex 4, a fast dissociation of L-Phe was observed, with conversion rates unaffected by the pH and presence of O2.",

            "abstract": "The synthesis of new arene and heteroarene scaffolds of therapeutic interest has generated a renewed interest in the domino radical cyclisation–Smiles. In this work we present a detailed mechanistic investigation of the radical version of a cascade involving a desulfonative Smiles rearrangement on an aromatic ring bearing a sulfonamide linker. Competing routes have been explored to characterize the molecular mechanism of the studied reaction. The knowledge gained from previous experimental observations is explained through the energy profile obtained by means of quantum mechanical calculations. This study answers questions about the rate determining step and the type of mechanism involved (two-step or concerted). Supplementary rate constant calculations as well as quantum molecular dynamics support experimental observations. An IGM-δg analysis performed along the reaction path unveils and quantifies an intramolecular π–π stacking interaction accelerating the reaction. This novel post processing IGM-δg tool based on the electron density, turns out to be useful to monitor and quantify specific intramolecular weak interactions along a reaction path from wave functions. From this mechanistic investigation it turns out that Smiles rearrangement here takes place in two steps rather than in a direct intramolecular radical substitution. Furthermore, we show that chain length effects must be taken into account in the functionalization of new sulfonylated derivatives subjected to this radical cascade, given their influence in the reaction rate.",

Their pure rotational spectra were successfully identified and characterized. However, due to the low thermal stability of these two chemicals, the measured rotational spectra were significantly congested with transitions corresponding to their decomposition products upon heating. We observed cyclopentanone and adipic anhydride in the spectrum of adipic acid and ε-caprolactone and its monohydrate in the spectrum of 6-hydroxycaproic acid. On the basis of the distinct fingerprints of both carboxylic acids and a series of their decomposition products, the spectra were analyzed in a time-segmented manner. This provides valuable insights into the thermal decomposition mechanisms of these two samples over time, which highlights the robustness of microwave spectroscopy as a potent tool for analyzing complex chemical mixtures in a species-, isomer-, and conformer-selective way.",

By LC-MS, FTIR, TGA, NMR, and HRMS analyses, it was shown that oxidized sucrose existed in the form of a hydrate, and the tetraaldehyde oxidized sucrose could isomerize into the form of two six-membered hemiacetal rings. The structure of oxidized sucrose was also verified by theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the diffusional properties of oxidized sucrose were investigated by the rolling-film method. Finally, it was found that oxidized sucrose used as a crosslinking agent could effectively improve the wrinkle recovery performance of cotton fabrics.",

            "abstract": "New efficient redox flow batteries (RFBs) are currently of great interest for large-scale storage of renewable energy. Further development requires the improvement of the redox active materials. Quantum chemical calculations allow the screening of large numbers of redox active molecules for required static molecular properties. In particular, redox potentials are calculated in high-throughput studies. In addition, calculations of solubility and reactivity and in-depth electronic structure analysis are performed for smaller numbers of molecules. In this review, we provide an overview of the static theoretical investigations carried out on the known classes of molecules that are considered as redox active materials in RFBs. We will focus on electronic structure methods such as density functional theory and wave function-based methods. Furthermore, investigations using the increasingly important machine learning techniques are presented. For each class of redox active molecules considered, significant theoretical results are presented and discussed. In addition, the different quantum chemical approaches used are examined, in particular with regard to their advantages and limitations. Another focus of this review is the comparison of theoretically predicted results with available experimental studies. Finally, future challenges and trends in the theoretical studies of redox active materials are highlighted.",

Mass spectrometry alone is, however, not able to distinguish between isomers. In this study, we demonstrate the use of both an experimental set-up using a differential mobility analyser, and computational ion mobility calculations for identification of isomers. In the experimental set-up, we combined electrospray ionisation with a differential mobility analyser time-of-flight mass spectrometer to separate environmentally relevant constitutional isomers, such as catechol, resorcinol and hydroquinone, and configurational isomers, such as cyclohexanediols and fatty acids (i.e., oleic and elaidic acids). Computational ion mobility predictions were obtained using the Ion Mobility Software (IMoS) program. We find that isomer separation can be achieved with the differential mobility analyser, while for catechol, resorcinol and hydroquinone, the computational predictions can reproduce the experimental order of the ion mobilities between the isomers, confirming the isomer identification. Our experimental set-up allows analysis both in the gas and liquid phase. The differential mobility analyser can, moreover, be combined with any mass spectrometry set-up, making it a versatile tool for the separation of isomers.",

With advances in computational power and method development, chemically accurate quantum chemistry methods that can predict ΔHf values for small molecules are available; however, large molecules are still out of reach. Increment theories provide a means of extending the prediction capability of high-level methods by decomposing the molecular ΔHf into the additive contributions from individual atoms, bonds, groups, or components. Here, we introduce a novel component increment theory, topology-automated force–field interaction component increment theory (TCIT), in which all component contributions are derived exclusively from Gaussian-4 (G4) results for algorithmically generated model compounds. In a benchmark evaluation of noncyclic compounds from the Pedley, Naylor, and Kline experimental ΔHf dataset, TCIT exhibits consistently lower signed and absolute errors compared with the conventional Benson group increment theory (BGIT). These results pave the way for future extensions of TCIT to ring-containing, ionic, and radical species for which experimental data scarcity currently limits the application of BGIT.",

            "abstract": "Heavy rare earth elements have emerged as pivotal metals for industrial advancements, playing an indispensable role across diverse fields. Nevertheless, their separation and purification pose considerable challenges. This work investigates the utilization of shear-induced dissociation coupled with ultrafiltration (SID-UF) as a separation process, employing phosphonic chitosan (PCS) as complexing agent for the separation and recovery of Dy(III), Yb(III), and Y(III). The results demonstrated that the rejection rates of rare earth ions surpassed 90.0 % at pH 6.0 with a PCS/RE mass ratio of 6. Notably, the stability of PCS-RE complexes in a shear field was studied and the critical rotating speeds at which the PCS-Dy, PCS-Yb and PCS-Y complexes began to dissociate were 1820, 2020 and 1460 rpm, respectively. Leveraging this difference in stability, the high separation coefficients between rare earth ions (βDy/Yb, βDy/Y and βYb/Y were 10.92, 12.38 and 13.3, respectively) were obtained. Successfully realizing the selective separation of ternary rare earth ions and the efficient recovery of the complexing agent was enabled through the methodical decomplexation of PCS-RE complexes. Furthermore, DFT calculations corroborated these experimental findings by confirming the PCS-Yb complex as the most stable (Eint = −38.80 kcal·mol−1) and PCS-Y as the least stable (Eint = –23.79 kcal·mol−1). Natural population analysis highlighted a correlation between complex stability and the extent of charge transfer from the ligand to the rare earth ion. Collectively, the experimental and theoretical results underscored that SID-UF is an efficient and eco-friendly technique for the selective separation of rare earth ions.",

            "abstract": "Condensation particle counter (CPC) instruments are commonly used to detect atmospheric nanoparticles. They operate on the basis of condensing an organic working fluid on the nanoparticle seeds to grow the particles to a detectable size, and at the size of few nanometers, their efficiency depends on how well the working fluid interacts with the seeds under the measurement conditions. This study models the first steps of heterogeneous nucleation of two working fluids commonly used in CPCs (diethylene glycol (DEG) and n-butanol) onto two positively charged seeds, ammonium bisulfate and tetramethylammonium bromide. The nucleation process is modeled on a molecular level using a combination of systematic configurational sampling and density functional theory (DFT). We take into account the conformational flexibility of DEG and n-butanol and determine the key factors that can improve the efficiency of nanoparticle measurements by CPCs. The results show that hydrogen bonding between the seed and the working fluid molecules is central to the adsorption of the first DEG/n-butanol molecules onto the seeds. However, intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the adsorbed molecules can also enhance the nucleation process for the weakly adsorbing vapor molecules. Accordingly, the heterogeneous nucleation probability is higher for working fluid–nanoparticle combinations with a higher potential for hydrogen bonding; in this case, DEG and ammonium bisulfate. Moreover, conformational analysis and methodology evaluations indicate that the consideration of adsorbate conformers and step-wise addition of the vapor molecules to the seeds is not essential for qualitative modeling of heterogeneous nucleation systems, at least for systems where the adsorbate and seed chemical properties are clearly different. This is the first molecular-level modeling study reporting detailed chemical reasons for experimentally observed seed and working fluid preferences in CPCs and reproducing the experimental observations. Our presented approach can be likely used for predicting preferences in similar nucleating systems.",

            "abstract": "Alkyl nitrates (ANs) are both sinks and sources of nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx = NO + NO2) in the atmosphere. Their reactions affect both the nitrogen cycle and ozone formation and therefore air quality and climate. ANs can be emitted to the atmosphere or produced in the gas phase. In either case, they can partition into aqueous aerosols, where they might undergo hydrolysis, producing highly soluble nitrate products, and act as a permanent sink for NOx. The kinetics of AN hydrolysis partly determines the extent of AN contribution to the nitrogen cycle. However, kinetics of many ANs in various aerosols is unknown, and there are conflicting arguments about the effect of acidity and basicity on the hydrolysis process. Using computational methods, this study proposes a mechanism for the reactions of methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl nitrates with OH– (hydroxyl ion; basic hydrolysis), water (neutral hydrolysis), and H3O+ (hydronium ion; acidic hydrolysis). Using quantum chemical data and transition state theory, we follow the effect of pH on the contribution of the basic, neutral, and acidic hydrolysis channels, and the rate coefficients of AN hydrolysis over a wide range of pH. Our results show that basic hydrolysis (i.e., AN reaction with OH–) is the most kinetically and thermodynamically favorable reaction among our evaluated reaction schemes. Furthermore, comparison of our kinetics results with experimental data suggests that there is an as yet unknown acidic mechanism responsible for acidic catalysis of AN hydrolysis.",

The most distinctive feature of the approach is the careful selection of different quantum chemical models for energies, geometries and vibrational frequencies with the aim of maximizing the accuracy of the overall description while retaining a reasonable cost for all the steps. In particular, a composite wave-function method is used for energies, whereas a double-hybrid functional (with the addition of core–valence correlation) is employed for geometries and harmonic frequencies and a cheaper hybrid functional for anharmonic contributions. A thorough benchmark based on a wide range of prototypical molecular bricks of life shows that the proposed strategy is close to the accuracy of state-of-the-art composite wave-function methods, and is applicable to much larger systems. A freely available web-utility post-processes the geometries optimized by standard electronic structure codes paving the way toward the accurate yet not prohibitively expensive study of medium- to large-sized molecules by experimentally-oriented researchers.",

In this DFT study, we demonstrate the adsorption performance of tetracyclic oligopyrrole (CTPy) towards NH3 and nitrogen halides including NF3, NCl3 and NBr3. The CTPy possesses infinite conjugation and highly active cavity which provides an excellent platform for the adsorption of upcoming gas molecules. Thermodynamically, the observed interaction energies of NH3, NF3, NCl3 and NBr3 analytes with CTPy at ωB97XD/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory are −13.14, −3.00, −6.00 and −7.50 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, the molecular dynamic simulations are performed at GFN2-xTB method to confirm the stability of CTPy and respective complexes. The SAPT0 and NCI analyses reveal that dispersion forces play a significant role to stablize these complexes. Moreover, the electrostatic component also contributes in stabilizing the NH3@CTPy, NCl3@CTPy and NBr3@CTPy complexes. The variation in the electronic properties including HOMO-LUMO gaps of complexes along with the significant NBO charge transfer indicate the increasing conductivity of CTPy upon complexation with reported analytes. The prominent charge transfer on interaction might be due to the increasing π to π* transition, thus the λmax is shifted to longer wavelength in UV–vis spectra.",

Their planar structures were elucidated based on the 1D and 2D NMR spectra and HRESIMS data. The absolute configurations of compounds 1–3 were determined by ECD calculations. Compound 3 represented a rare fully symmetrical isobenzofuran dimer. All compounds were evaluated for their α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and compounds 1, 4–7, and 9 exhibited more potent α-glucosidase inhibitory effect with IC50 values ranging from 17.04 to 292.47 μM than positive control acarbose with IC50 value of 822.97 μM, indicating that these phenolic compounds could be promising lead compounds of new hypoglycemic drugs.",

Effects of EC viscosity and EC/GO mass ratio on the physicochemical properties were studied. Besides, interactions between the components were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The EC with a viscosity of 18–22 mPa s resulted in slightly higher oil binding capacity (99.84% vs 98.55% at 10% EC, and 99.92% vs 99.49% at 12% EC) and significantly stronger hardness and gel strength of DAG oil oleogels than EC with a viscosity of 45–55 mPa s. Moreover, the hardness and rheological properties of oleogels were negatively correlated to GO addition. MD simulation was used to understand this effect of GO addition, showing that EC-GO complex had lower binding energy (−107.14 kJ/mol) than the complexes of GO-DAG (−105.64 kJ/mol) and EC-DAG (−101.96 kJ/mol), leading to the disruption of the capacity of EC to structure DAG-rich oil. Interactions between the components were mainly governed by van der Waals interactions. The peroxide value of the oleogels decreased by 1.89 mmol/kg as EC18/GO mass ratio changed from 12:0 to 12:4, indicating good antioxidant activity of GO. Overall, the characteristics of DAG oil oleogels could be modulated by the addition of GO. The study may provide considerable potential to develop healthy and stable oleogels with high DAG, low saturated and trans-fatty acids for food industry.",

This study aims to clarify the efficacy of xanthan application in the photocatalytic removal of nadolol, pindolol, and cefoperazone from water reservoirs. Under the influence of a simulated solar light source, xanthan exhibited significant degradation rates for pindolol (77%) and cefoperazone (91%). In contrast, nadolol's degradation efficiency was notably lower (10%). These findings suggest that the molecular structure can substantially influence the efficiency of the purification process. Computational analyses were conducted to gain a more profound understanding of the implications of molecular structure.",

As the carrier of MnFe2O4, NBCs were synthesized from alfalfa, which has large specific surface area, graphite like structure and hierarchical porous structure. The adsorption isotherm indicated that NBCs/MnFe2O4-2:1 had the best adsorption performance for TC (347.56 mg g−1). Through synergistic adsorption and photocatalysis, the removal rate of TC reached 84%, which was significantly higher than that of MnFe2O4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Photoluminescence (PL) characterization results showed that the introduction of NBCs improved the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron and hole pairs and enhanced the photocatalytic performance. Moreover, the adsorption, degradation mechanism and degradation path of TC by the catalyst were systematically analyzed by coupling HPLC–MS measurement with the theoretical calculation. Considering the advantages of excellent degradation performance, low cost, easy separation and environmental friendliness of NBCs/MnFe2O4, this work was expected to provide a new path for the practical application of biochar.",

Their structures and absolute configurations were determined through synergetic use of extensive spectroscopic analysis, quantum chemical calculations, and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Noteworthily, 1 represents the first example of cytochalasan possessing an unusual 2H-isoxazole moiety. Additionally, their cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities were initially evaluated, and 3 showed a moderate inhibitory effect against the NO production.",

            "abstract": "NaF-rich electrode–electrolyte interphases play crucial roles in determining the cycling stability of sodium metal batteries (SMBs) because of their electronic insulation and mechanical stability. In this work, perfluorobenzene (PFB) is proposed as the additive to contribute the formation of NaF-rich solid electrolyte interphases (SEI). PFB at the periphery of the solvation layer can pull out a part of the EC with the lowest solvation energy by Van der Waals forces, thus allowing more PF6−{\\bf PF_\\bf 6^\\bm - \\ to participate in the Na+ solvation layer and form an anion-aggregated solvation sheath, thus promoting the decomposition of PF6−{\\bf PF_\\bf 6^\\bm - \\ to produce NaF. In addition, PFB has a higher highest occupied molecular orbital and lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, which also preferentially decomposes to produce NaF at both electrodes. Benefiting from the intensified NaF ratio in SEI, the Na||Na symmetric cells with such an electrolyte achieves a superior cycling life over 350 h at 1 mA cm−2, and the Na||Na3V2(PO4)2O2F batteries also realize ultrahigh cycling performance with 88.8% capacity retention after 500 cycles.",

Taking the [TaC4O8]+ ion–molecule complex formed in the laser ablation source as a representative, the reactivity of the tantalum metal cation towards CO2 molecules is explored using infrared photodissociation spectroscopy combined with quantum chemical calculations. The strong absorption in the carbonyl stretching region provides solid evidence for the insertion reactions into CO bonds by the tantalum cation. Two inserted oxocarbonyl products are identified based on the great agreement between the experimental results and simulated infrared spectra of energetically low-lying structures in the singlet and triplet states. The pivotal role of two-state reactivity in driving CO2 activation among three different spin states is rationalized by potential energy surface analysis. Our conclusion provides valuable insight into the intrinsic mechanisms of CO2 activation by the tantalum metal cation, highlighting the affinity of tantalum for CO bond insertion in addition to typical “end-on” binding configurations.",

The reaction mode derives from an orchestrated nitrene-mediated three-component inert C(sp3)-H bond cascade reaction consisting of C–H alkylation, olefination, and allylation. The process is facilitated by easily obtainable and bifunctional amidation reagents, aryl-substituted 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones, which can be transformed into amide directing group via a rhodium–nitrene intermediate. DFT calculations reveal that the chemoselectivity between C–N and C–C bond formation was highly controllable. The synthetic utility of this multicomponent reaction is highlighted by late-stage C–H functionalization of various complex natural macrocyclic compounds, triterpenoids, biologically active molecules and drugs. Moreover, it enables access to the expedient and diversified synthesis of complex macrolactams and the unique oxime-containing macrolactams show potent anti-Flu （H1N1）activity with no cytotoxicity.",

            "abstract": "Inverse vulcanization is a promising route to stabilize sulfur in lithium–sulfur batteries, but the resulting sulfur strand lengths in the materials are elusive. We address the strand length by characterization via sulfur near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Theoretical predictions of NEXAFS spectra for model molecules containing strands with up to three sulfur atoms are verified by experiment. The near perfect agreement between simulation and experiment on the absolute energy scale allows for the predictions for larger chain lengths also. Inspection and interpretation of NEXAFS spectra from real battery materials on this basis reveals the appearance of single connecting sulfur atoms for very low sulfur content, and of longer strands when the sulfur fraction increases.",

            "abstract": "A combination of Artificial Bee Colony algorithm, eXtended Tight Binding and Density functional theory methods were performed to study the activation process of carbon dioxide (CO2) over copper (Cu4 cluster) based catalytic systems. The findings revealed that the activation of the C–O bond resulted from the electron transfer to σ*, π* - MO of CO2. The more the electrons are transferred to CO2, the more the C–O bond is activated and elongated. The suitability of several metal oxide supports (Fe2O3, Al2O3, MgO, ZnO) is estimated using calculated electronic parameters (global electrophilicity index, vertical ionization potential and vertical electron affinity). Aside from demonstrating the appropriateness of Al2O3 and ZnO, a thorough examination of MgO revealed that, due to the formation of stable carbonate products, this oxide is not really appropriate as a support for copper-based catalysts in CO2 conversion. Our studies have also shown that the electron enrichment of copper atoms plays a key role in the activation of C–O bonds. Alkali metal doping (Li, K, Cs) significantly improves the catalytic efficiency of the Cu4 cluster. Based on the results of electron transfer to the CO2 molecule, the effect of doping alkali metal atoms may be organized in the following order: Cs > K > Li. A new core/shell catalytic system with potassium atoms in the core and copper atoms in the shell has been proposed and has proven to be a promising, efficient catalytic system in the CO2 adsorption and activation.",

Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses, electronic circular dichroism (EC) and specific rotation (SR) calculations. Compound 1 represented a new family of guaiane-type sesquiterpenoids featuring an unprecedented [5/6/6/7] tetracyclic system. A plausible biosynthetic pathway for compounds 1–7 was proposed. The anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and multidrug resistance reversal activities of the isolates were evaluated. Compounds 1, 2 and 7 exhibited potent inhibitory activities against Candida albicans with MIC values ranging from 1.60 to 6.30 μM, and suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production with IC50 ranging from 4.60 to 20.00 μM. Additionally, all compounds (100 μg/mL) enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549/DDP). This study opened up a new source for obtaining bioactive guaiane-type sesquiterpenoids and compounds 1, 2, and 7 were promising for further optimization as multifunctional inhibitors for anti-fungal (C. albicans) and anti-inflammatory purposes.",

            "abstract": "Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is a major source of phenolic compounds (PCs) in the aquatic environment and terrestrial, growing concern over the health and environmental impacts of phenolic pollutants. Hereon, a “nanomagnet-inspired” molecularly imprinted nanofiber membranes (E-LMIMs) toward luteolin (LTL, a representative PC) were prepared by electrospinning method. Biosynthesized manganese nanoparticles (MnNPs, negatively charged) were uniformly blended in polyacrylonitrile (PAN) by electrostatic repulsion interaction. The -OH and -COOH groups on the surface of biomass MnNPs provided “signposts” for LTL to anchor at the designated sites during the imprinted polymerization, significantly improving the efficiency of imprinted sites. The positively charged chitosan (CS) was covered on nanofiber membranes to form a hydration layer for enhancing the high tensile strength and antifouling performance in extreme environments. The high matching effect of the MnNPs and the covalent/non-covalent interactions between rebinding sites and LTL greatly improved the transport selectivity. Isothermal and kinetic rebinding, permeation and transportation, and dynamic separation were investigated to propose the selective separation mechanism. As a consequence, optimized E-LMIMs with sufficient specific recognition sites contributed to greatly improving the selectivity coefficients (3.55 and 4.20), separation factors (4.04), and permselectivity coefficients (4.41 and 5.41). This study demonstrates that customized surface modification may serve as an effective approach for preparing high selectivity and permeability OMW treatment media.",

In the present study, to better reveal and confirm the structural information of [Eu(Ox)x (H2O)h−2x]3−2x (h = 8, 9; x = 0–3) aqueous species, especially the variable coordination number (CN), and explore the validity of the spectral linear correlation between the luminescence lifetime and the residual hydration number in the first coordination sphere of Eu(III) compounds in solution, a comparison between the spectral results and the theoretical calculations in a wide parametric space in terms of the pH value and oxalate concentration was carried out by combining time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy (TRLS) with speciation modelling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We have found direct and clear evidence for the 9-fold to 8-fold coordination number reduction of Eu(III) atoms upon coordination with more than one oxalate in an aqueous medium, and as well systematically validated the applicability of the spectral linear correlation in an aqueous system (otherwise solid state) involving multiple species with the support of relatively reliable and clear speciation modelling.",

However, we still have little knowledge on how the molecular structures of the SMAs influence their photovoltaic properties. For the purpose of gaining more insight into the relationship between the molecular properties and photovoltaic performance of the SMAs, here, we carried out theoretical calculations on the most representative SMAs, such as ITIC, Y6, and their derivatives through molecular simulations, and tried to reveal their unique characteristic and aggregation behavior related to the general performance in OSCs, potentially helping to further improve the efficiency of OSCs.",

            "abstract": "In the atmosphere, water in all phases is ubiquitous and plays important roles in catalyzing atmospheric chemical reactions, participating in cluster formation and affecting the composition of aerosol particles. Direct measurements of water-containing clusters are limited because water is likely to evaporate before detection, and therefore, theoretical tools are needed to study hydration in the atmosphere. We have studied thermodynamics and population dynamics of the hydration of different atmospherically relevant base monomers as well as sulfuric acid–base pairs. The hydration ability of a base seems to follow in the order of gas-phase base strength whereas hydration ability of acid–base pairs, and thus clusters, is related to the number of hydrogen binding sites. Proton transfer reactions at water–air interfaces are important in many environmental and biological systems, but a deeper understanding of their mechanisms remain elusive. By studying thermodynamics of proton transfer reactions in clusters containing up to 20 water molecules and a base molecule, we found that that the ability of a base to accept a proton in a water cluster is related to the aqueous-phase basicity. We also studied the second deprotonation reaction of a sulfuric acid in hydrated acid–base clusters and found that sulfate formation is most favorable in the presence of dimethylamine. Molecular properties related to the proton transfer ability in water clusters are discussed.",

NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the desired compounds confirmed their E conformation. The light-induced E ↔ Z (also called trans ↔ cis) isomerization was monitored using UV-VIS and 1H NMR spectroscopy that revealed a reversible photochromic behavior governed by first-order kinetics. State-of-the-art meta-dynamics simulations (iMTD-GC) and ab initio calculations (CASSCF-NEVPT2 and STEOM-DLPNO-CCSD) made the analysis of the electronic structures of ligands possible, which helped to explain the bland E-to-Z conversion of L1 and pronounced switching of L2–L5 ligands. Furthermore, the computational studies identified the active wavelengths of E-to-Z conversion and allowed assessing the mechanisms of photoisomerization. Additionally, ligands L1 and L2 were used for the preparation of four ferrous coordination compounds C1–C4 in which the structural and magnetic investigations confirmed the permanent low-spin state and diamagnetic behavior in the solid state. On the other hand, dissolved compounds C1 and C2 are high-spin at room temperature and their blue light irradiation causes the decomplexation instead of the desired E-to-Z isomerization.",

            "abstract": "Benzothiazole derivatives were used as models to study the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) from an experimental and theoretical point of view. The experimental electronic and vibrational results were compared with a comprehensive selection of state-of-the-art computational methods in a workflow approach. The latter were performed based on modern techniques, such as DLPNO-CCSD(T), which gives the reference energies and current methodologies for ESIPT analysis, such as molecular dynamics and charge density difference testing. The theoretical vibrational results were focused on the stretch vibrational-mode of the hydroxyl group, which indicated a large increase in the intramolecular hydrogen bond strength, which facilitates the ESIPT process. Theoretically, the optimization of a large number of molecules shows that π-stacking plays a fundamental role in benzothiazole stabilization, with a remarkably strong intramolecular hydrogen bond. The potential energy surface of the ESIPT reactive benzothiazole (4HBS) has a clear transition state where ESIPT is easily observed with a large difference in energy between the enol and keto tautomer. Additionally, molecular dynamics showed that the ESIPT process occurs very fast. The tautomer appears around 8.7 fs and the enolic form is regenerated in just 24 fs, closing the Förster cycle. The calculated Stokes shift could be related to the ESIPT process and the experimental solid-state emission spectrum matched almost perfectly with the theoretical one. In contrast, for the non-ESIPT benzothiazole (4HBSN), the agreement between theory and experiment was limited, probably due to intermolecular interaction effects that are not considered in these calculations.",

Organic aerosols have been identified as potential cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and amino acids are organic molecules that could serve as CCN. Amino acids make up a significant portion of the total organic material in the atmosphere, and herein we present a systematic study of hydration for two of the most common atmospheric amino acids, glycine and serine. We compute DLPNO/CCSD(T)//M08-HX/MG3S thermodynamic properties and atmospheric concentrations of Gly(H2O)n and Ser(H2O)n, where n = 1–5. We predict that serine–water clusters have higher concentrations at n = 1 and 5, while glycine–water clusters have higher concentrations at n = 2–4. However, both glycine and serine are inferred to exist primarily in their nonhydrated monomer forms in the absence of other species such as sulfuric acid.",

Herein, we report detailed quantum chemical studies on the reaction mechanism of E-selective ROMP of norborn-2-ene (NBE) with Mo(N-2,6-Me2-C6H3)(CHCMe3)(IMes)(OTf)2 (1, IMes = 1,3-dimesitylimidazol-2-ylidene) as a first step to stereoselective polymerization. Four different reaction pathways based on an enesyn or eneanti approach of NBE to either the syn- or anti-isomer of the neutral precatalyst have been studied. In contrast to the recently established associative mechanism with a terminal alkene, where a neutral olefin adduct is formed, NBE reacts directly with the catalyst via [2 + 2] cycloaddition to form molybdacyclobutane with a reaction barrier about 30 kJ mol–1 lower in free energy than via the formation of a catalyst–monomer adduct. However, the direct cycloaddition of NBE was only found for one out of four stereoisomers. Our findings strongly suggest that this stereoselective approach is responsible for E-selectivity and point toward a substrate-specific reaction mechanism in olefin metathesis with neutral Mo imido alkylidene N-heterocyclic carbene bistriflate complexes.",

            "abstract": "The photochemical deracemization of 2,4-disubstituted 2,3-butadienamides (allene amides) was investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The reaction was catalyzed by a thioxanthone which is covalently linked to a chiral 1,5,7-trimethyl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-2-one skeleton providing a U-shaped arrangement of the sensitizing unit relative to a potential hydrogen-bonding site. Upon irradiation at λ = 420 nm in the presence of the sensitizer (2.5 mol %), the amides reached at −10 °C a photostationary state in which one enantiomer prevailed. The enantioenriched allene amides (70–93% ee) were isolated in 74% to quantitative yield (19 examples). Based on luminescence data and DFT calculations, energy transfer from the thioxanthone to the allene amides is thermodynamically feasible, and the achiral triplet allene intermediate was structurally characterized. Hydrogen bonding of the amide enantiomers to the sensitizer was monitored by NMR titration. The experimental association constants (Ka) were similar (59.8 vs 25.7 L·mol–1). DFT calculations, however, revealed a significant difference in the binding properties of the two enantiomers. The major product enantiomer exhibits a noncovalent dispersion interaction of its arylmethyl group to the external benzene ring of the thioxanthone, thus moving away the allene from the carbonyl chromophore. The minor enantiomer displays a CH−π interaction of the hydrogen atom at the terminal allene carbon atom to the same benzene ring, thus forcing the allene into close proximity to the chromophore. The binding behavior explains the observed enantioselectivity which, as corroborated by additional calculations, is due to a rapid triplet energy transfer within the substrate-catalyst complex of the minor enantiomer.",

            "abstract": "In cryogenic ion vibrational predissociation (CIVP) spectroscopy, the influence of the tag on the spectrum is an important consideration. Whereas for small ions several studies have shown that the tag effects can be significant, these effects are less understood for large ions or for large numbers of tags. Nevertheless, it is commonly assumed that if the investigated molecular ion is large enough, the perturbations arising from the tag are small and can therefore be neglected in the interpretation. In addition, it is generally assumed that the more weakly bound the tag is, the less it perturbs the CIVP spectrum. Under these assumptions, CIVP spectra are claimed to be effectively IR absorption spectra of the free molecular ion. Having observed unexpected splittings in otherwise unproblematic CIVP spectra of some tagged ions, we report Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations that strongly indicate that mobility among the more weakly bound tags leads to the surprising splittings. We compared the behavior of two tags commonly used in CIVP spectroscopy (H2 and N2) with a large pyridinium cation. Our experimental results surprisingly show that under the appropriate circumstances, the more weakly bound tag can perturb the CIVP spectra more than the more strongly bound tag by not just shifting but also splitting the observed bands. The more weakly bound tag had significant residence times at several spectroscopically distinct sites on the molecular ion. This indicates that the weakly bound tag is likely to sample several binding sites in the experiment, some of which involve interaction with the reporter chromophore.",

Comprehensive spectral analysis and a quantum chemical calculation strategy were employed to determine their structures. These compounds represent four previously unreported nordrimane carbon skeletal types in Salvia genus, including 15-nor-drimane, 11,15-di-nor-drimane, 14,15-di-nor-drimane, and 11,14,15-tri-nor-drimane sesquiterpenes. All compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against several human cancer cell lines (A549, H460, Hep3B, MCF7, PC3, and HeLa). The results showed that 3 exhibited low activity against MCF7 cells (IC50,72.72 ± 6.95 μM) and moderate activity against HeLa cells (IC50, 9.80 ± 0.64 μM). Moreover, the EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) assay demonstrates that 3 displays dose-dependent efficacy in suppressing the proliferation of HeLa cells. Network pharmacology and molecular docking technology implied that 3 may potentially bind to Src (proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase) to exert anti-proliferative activity.",

Starting from monoradicals of the type [⋅P(μ-NTer)2P−R], we have now succeeded in linking two such monoradical phosphorus centers by appropriate choice of a linker. To this end, biradical [⋅P(μ-NTer)2P⋅] (1) was treated with 1,6-dibromohexane, affording the brominated species Br[P(μ-NTer)]22C6H12 (3). Subsequent reduction with KC8 led to the formation of the disbiradical ⋅[P(μ-NTer)]22C6H12 (4) featuring a large distance between the radical phosphorus sites in the solid state and formally the highest biradical character observed in a P-centered biradical so far, approaching 100 %. EPR spectroscopy revealed a three-line signal in solution with a considerably larger exchange interaction than would be expected from the molecular structure of the single crystal. Quantum chemical calculations revealed a highly dynamic conformational space; thus, the two radical sites can approach each other with a much smaller distance in solution. Further reduction of 4 resulted in the formation of a potassium salt featuring the first structurally characterized P-centered distonic radical anion (5−). Moreover, 4 could be used in small molecule activation.",

            "container-title": "Chemical Papers",
            "abstract": "The polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) microplastics (MPs) can act as carriers of the molecule 3-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (3BHA), which propose harmful impacts to aqueous ecosystems. Meanwhile, 3BHA has already been detected in several environments and human urine and serum samples. 3BHA is an antioxidant in foods, food packaging, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. However, it raised concerns about its possible endocrine-disrupting effect in recent years. The interaction between two MPs and 3BHA could start in farmland and be maintained during transportation to the ocean. Herein, the adsorption behavior and mechanism of 3BHA by PE and PP MPs were investigated via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, density functional theory (DFT), non-covalent interactions (NCI), the total density of states (TDOS) and frontier molecular orbital (FMO). Furthermore, the stability of 3BHA adsorbed complexes was investigated by adsorption-free energies (ΔGads), showing that the 3BHA has a significant interaction with the MPs studied, with energies of -1.31 kcal mol−1 and − 4.19 kcal mol−1 for PE and PP, respectively. Intermolecular van der Waals forces were one of the primary adsorption mechanisms of 3BHA by MPs, as evidenced by NCI calculations. It was demonstrated that the adsorption of the 3BHA in MPs decreases the energy gap (Eg) of the HOMO and LUMO orbitals; for PE MP, the Eg decreases from 12.8386 to 9.1445 eV, and from 12.7957 to 9.2092 eV for PP MP. The adsorption of the 3BHA on the MPs resulted in an increase in the TDOS distribution and a slight shift in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) states. In conclusion, this study about the mechanism of adsorption of the 3BHA in PE and PP MPs can provide new evidence and enhance our understanding of the environmental behavior of 3BHA in the environment.",

To characterize the resonance position and decay width of the metastable states, we employed the newly developed DLPNO-based EA-EOM-CCSD method in conjunction with the resonance via Padé (RVP) method. Our calculations show that the presence of water molecules causes a redshift in the resonance position and an increase in the lifetime for the three lowest-lying resonance states of cytosine. Furthermore, there are some indications that the lowest resonance state in isolated cytosine may get converted to a bound state in the presence of an aqueous environment. The obtained results are extremely sensitive to the basis set used for the calculations.",

            "abstract": "The umpolung functionalization of imines bears vast synthetic potential, but polarity inversion is less efficient compared with the carbonyl counterparts. Strong nucleophiles are often required to react with the N-electrophiles without catalytic and stereochemical control. Here we show an effective strategy to realize umpolung of imines promoted by organocatalytic aromatization. The attachment of strongly electron-withdrawing groups to imines could enhance the umpolung reactivity by both electronegativity and aromatic character, enabling the direct amination of (hetero)arenes with good efficiencies and stereoselectivities. Additionally, the application of chiral Brønsted acid catalyst furnishes (hetero)aryl C–N atropisomers or enantioenriched aliphatic amines via dearomative amination from N-electrophilic aromatic precursors. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations suggest an ionic mechanism for the umpolung reaction of imines. This disconnection expands the options to forge C–N bonds stereoselectively on (hetero)arenes, which represents an important synthetic pursuit, especially in medicinal chemistry.",

However, some acrylates are mutagenic and the aim of this article is to explain the mutagenicity in terms of the atomic population redistribution in the molecule using two new descriptors which are based on atomic populations framed in the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. They describe the electron-withdrawing effect of a group of atoms in a molecule. The descriptors consider substituents of prop-2-enoates, the number of the acrolein units and the electrophilicity. The cluster analysis using these descriptors allows to classify acrylates in terms of the number of acrolein backbones and the type of the substituent group. Five main groups can be distinguished: monoacrylates with monomethacrylates, diacrylates with dimethacrylates, triacrylates, trimethacrylate and monoacrylates with electron-rich substituents. The substituents of mutagenic acrylates are electron withdrawing. This makes the acrolein backbone β-carbon more electrophilic and the molecule more reactive.",

CID-MS2 results have shown that the addition of one oxygen atom occurs on the nucleobase moiety. The gas-phase geometries of +16 mass increment products of 2’-deoxyadenosine (dA(O)H+), 2’-deoxyadenosine 5’-monophosphate (dAMP(O)H+), 2’-deoxycytidine (dC(O)H+), and 2’-deoxycytidine 5’-monophosphate (dCMP(O)H+) are extensively investigated by IRMPD spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations. We show that a carbonyl group is formed at the C8 position after oxidation of 2’-deoxyadenosine and its monophosphate derivative. For 2’-deoxycytidine and its monophosphate derivative, the oxygen atom is added to the C5 position to form a C−OH group. IRMPD spectroscopy has been employed for the first time to provide direct structural information on oxidative lesions in DNA model systems.",

Thus, accurately predicting the maximum UV–Vis wavelength (λmax) values is critical in designing dye-conjugated material. Extensive metadynamics simulations were carried out to generate capsanthin conformers at various levels of the extended tight-binding method. Benchmarking the time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) methods help understand the results of a particular functional and allows a comparison between results obtained with different functional. The long-range correction (LC) scheme in LC-TD-DFT-D4/ωB97X/def2-SVP has been found to reproduce the experimental λmax, and exhibited the effect of conformational changes to the calculated wavelengths. On the other hand, an inexpensive yet efficient LC-TD-DFTB method reproduced the experimental λmax insensitive to conformational changes.",

            "abstract": "Effective electrolyte compositions are of primary importance in raising the performance of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Recently, fluorinated cyclic phosphazenes in combination with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) have been introduced as promising electrolyte additives, which can decompose to form an effective dense, uniform, and thin protective layer on the surface of electrodes. Although the basic electrochemical aspects of cyclic fluorinated phosphazenes combined with FEC were introduced, it is still unclear how these two compounds interact constructively during operation. This study investigates the complementary effect of FEC and ethoxy(pentafluoro)cyclotriphosphazene (EtPFPN) in aprotic organic electrolyte in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O ∥ SiOx/C full cells. The formation mechanism of lithium ethyl methyl carbonate (LEMC)-EtPFPN interphasial intermediate products and the reaction mechanism of lithium alkoxide with EtPFPN are proposed and supported by Density Functional Theory calculations. A novel property of FEC is also discussed here, called molecular-cling-effect (MCE). To the best knowledge, the MCE has not been reported in the literature, although FEC belongs to one of the most investigated electrolyte additives. The beneficial MCE of FEC toward the sub-sufficient solid-electrolyte interphase forming additive compound EtPFPN is investigated via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, gas chromatography high resolution-accurate mass spectrometry, in situ shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.",

            "abstract": "The synthesis and self-assembling features of the N-annulated perylene diimide (NPBI) 1 in different solvents are reported. Compound 1 possesses two chiral linkers, derived from (S)-(+)-alaninol, that connect the central aromatic NPBI segment and the peripheral trialkoxybenzamide units. The Ala-based linker has been demonstrated to strongly favor the formation of intramolecularly H-bonded seven-membered pseudocycles. NPBI 1 shows a strong tendency to self-assemble even in a good solvent like CHCl3 and the formation of chiral dimers is detected in this good solvent. Both experimental techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the intramolecular H-bonded pseudocycles are very robust and the formation of chiral dimers is driven by the π-stacking of two units of the NPBI core. Unexpectedly, an efficient transfer of the asymmetry of the point chirality at the linker to the aromatic moiety is observed in the molecularly dissolved state. Changing the solvent to more apolar methylcyclohexane modifies the self-assembly process and the formation of chiral supramolecular polymers is detected. The supramolecular polymerization of 1 is demonstrated to follow an isodesmic mechanism unlike previous referable systems. In the formation of the supramolecular polymers of 1, the combination of experimental and computational data indicates that the H-bonded pseudocycles are also present in the aggregated state and the rope-like, columnar aggregates formed by the self-assembly of 1 rely on the π-stacking of the NPBI backbones.",

This study focuses on the thermal decomposition of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) using nanoreactor simulations to find the decomposition products and their respective energies. Applying the nanoreactor method, which is novel for this system, allows for rapid prediction of thermal decomposition pathways with minimal researcher bias and it predicted PFOA to decompose at ∼650 °C, consistent with previously reported experimental studies.",

Photolysis of the matrix-isolated TX, induced by in situ broadband (λ>235 nm) or narrowband (λ in the range 220–263 nm) irradiation, led to new bands in the infrared spectrum that could be ascribed to two distinct photoproducts, oxepane-2,5-dione, and 4-oxohomoadamantan-5-one. Our studies show that these photoproducts result from initial photoinduced cleavage of an O−O bond, with the formation of an oxygen-centered diradical that regioselectivity rearranges to a more stable (secondary carbon-centered)/(oxygen-centered) diradical, yielding the final products. Formation of the diradical species was confirmed by EPR measurements, upon photolysis of the compound at λ=266 nm, in acetonitrile ice (T=10–80 K). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies demonstrated that the TX molecule adopts nearly the same conformation in the crystal and matrix-isolation conditions, revealing that the intermolecular interactions in the TX crystal are weak. This result is in keeping with observed similarities between the infrared spectrum of the crystalline material and that of matrix-isolated TX. The detailed structural, vibrational, and photochemical data reported here appear relevant to the practical uses of TX in medicinal chemistry, considering its efficient and broad parasiticidal properties.",

Notably, the successful encapsulation of H2O2 could be observed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Metadynamics and density functional theory calculations reveal that the adsorption of H2O2 molecules through the chiral channels induces chiral distribution of subsequent guests to form a host–guest recognition system of H2O2@HSTC-1, which slows down the oxidation of the host framework. This work provides unique insights for the construction of intelligent protection matrix materials and is of great significance in the fields of pharmacochemistry and biomedicine.",

            "abstract": "The rich conformational landscape including the associated conformational conversion paths of the hydrogen-bonded binary 3,3,3-trifluoropropanol (TFP) aggregate was explored using chirped pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy and computational chemistry. To appropriately identify the binary TFP conformers responsible for the five sets of candidate rotational transitions assigned, we established a set of important conformational assignment criteria. These include an extensive conformational search, good agreement between the experimental and theoretical rotational constants, relative magnitude of the three dipole moment components, and quartic centrifugal distortion constants, and observation and non-observation of the predicted conformers. Extensive conformational searches were carried out using CREST, a conformational search tool, producing hundreds of structural candidates. The CREST candidates were screened using a multitier approach and subsequently the low energy conformers (<25 kJ mol−1) were optimized at the B3LYP-D3BJ/def2-TZVP level, leading to 62 minima within an energy window of 10 kJ mol−1. Good agreement with the predicted spectroscopic properties mentioned above allowed us to clearly identify five binary TFP conformers as the molecular carriers. Particularly, a combined kinetic and thermodynamic model was developed, which provides a satisfactory explanation for the observation and non-observation of the low energy conformers predicted. The role of the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in the stability ordering of the binary conformers is discussed.",

            "abstract": "Indolizines and their saturated derivatives are important structural motifs present in several biologically active compounds of both natural and synthetic origin. We describe herein a one-pot approach for the synthesis of tricyclic indolizines catalyzed by a bicyclic imidazole-alcohol. The protocol is based on an aqueous Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction between pyridine-2-carboxaldehydes and six- or seven-membered cyclic enones, followed by sequential intramolecular cyclization and dehydration. So, in a single operational step two new bonds (C–C and C–N) are formed in an organocatalyzed process that takes place in simple conditions (stirring in water at 60 °C for 12 h) and with great atom economy (water as the sole byproduct), affording the purified compounds in yields ranging from 19 to 70%. The facility of the cyclization strongly depends on the size of the cycloalkenone ring: while MBH adducts derived from six-, seven- or eight-membered cycloenones are readily transformed into the corresponding indolizines, cyclopentenone-derived MBH adducts do not cyclize. A competition experiment revealed that cycloheptenone-derived MBH adducts cyclize faster than cyclohexenone-derived adducts. Model DFT calculations have been performed to rationalize these reactivity trends.",

However, the β-H elimination of the alkenyl palladium species leading to allene is an energetically unfavored process, and therefore, it has been a long-standing challenge in control of this process via enantioselective manner. We developed a concise and efficient methodology to construct trisubstituted chiral allenes from stereodefined fully substituted enol triflates by the enantioselective β-H elimination of the alkenyl palladium species under mild conditions. The identified Xu-Phos play a crucial role in the chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity. Multiple linear regression analysis shows the important steric effect on enantioselectivity. DFT computation results allow us to propose an intramolecular base (−OAc)–assisted deprotonation mechanism for this progress. Distortion-interaction and energy decomposition analysis indicate that the difference in electrostatic energy (Eelec) of the two intramolecular base-assisted deprotonation transition states dominates the stereoselectivity.",

            "abstract": "Spiroleiferthione A (1), with a 2-thiohydantoin a heterocyclic spiro skeleton, and oleiferthione A (2), an imidazole-2-thione derivative, were isolated from the aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera Lam. seeds. The unprecedented structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic data, X-ray diffraction, and gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) NMR calculation, as well as electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculation. The structures of 1 and 2 were determined to be (5R,7R,8S)-8-hydroxy-3-(4′-hydroxybenzyl)-7-methyl-2-thioxo-6-oxa-1, 3-diazaspiro [4.4] nonan-4-one, and 1-(4′-hydroxybenzyl)-4,5-dimethyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-imidazole-2-thione, respectively. Biosynthetic pathways for 1 and 2 have been proposed. Compounds 1 and 2 are considered to have originated from isothiocyanate and then undergone a series of oxidation and cyclization reactions to form 1 and 2. Compounds 1 and 2 demonstrated weak inhibition rates of NO production, 42.81 ± 1.56% and 33.53 ± 2.34%, respectively, at a concentration of 50 μM. Additionally, Spiroleiferthione A demonstrated moderate inhibitory activity against high glucose-induced human renal mesangial cell proliferation in a dosage-dependent manner. A wider range of biological activities, and the diabetic nephropathy protective activity of Compound 1 in vivo and its mechanism of action, need further investigation after the sufficient enrichment of Compound 1 or total synthesis.",

            "abstract": "Optical absorption spectra of films of squaraine dye C28H27O2N2 deposited at different rates on quartz substrates, silver and gold nanoparticles, and silver nanoparticles coated with radiation-modified polyethylene glycol were studied. It was shown that depending on the rate of deposition of molecules, J- and H-type aggregates are formed. The J-aggregation changed when dyes were deposited on silver and gold nanoparticles, this could be confirmed by the significant restructuring of the spectrum and bathochromic shift of the absorption band. The quantum chemical calculations for the complex of the dye with silver nanoparticle, which consists of 128 Ag atoms, were carried out. It was shown that the alternation of charges appears on the atoms of the dye molecule. This was noticeably different from the charges observed for the atoms of the free molecule, which points to the interaction in the dye-AgNP complex that can lead to a shift of the absorption spectra. Calculations of the electronic structure of the complex containing the dye C28H27O2N2 with polyethylene glycol (PEG) indicate that changes in the optical absorption spectrum are caused by rearrangement and formation of new molecular orbitals, delocalized on both components of the complex.",

These compounds were used as precursors to prepare meso-substituted derivatives. The cyanine dye precursors presented UV-Vis absorption, related to fully allowed electronic transitions and fluorescence emission in the NIR region, without any evidence of aggregation in both ground and excited states. The substitution at the meso position showed a fundamental role in their photophysics, with the main absorption in the green-orange region related to the monomeric species. Moreover, the excited state photophysics presented emission profiles dependent on the excitation wavelengths, complicating the correlation of spectroscopy and structure. Density Functional Theory and OO-SCS-MP2 calculations under different solvation conditions revealed the heavy impact of conjugation effects on ground and excited states’ geometries and electronic configurations of these compounds. Finally, the observed photophysical features of the meso-substituted heptamethine cyanine dyes were successfully used to explore their application as fluorescent probes in biological media, allowing stable staining in live and fixed cells.",

To that end, the slurry needs a required pumping time ensured by the addition of retarders. Although zinc has been widely known to prolong the setting time of geopolymers, its mechanism of action has yet to be fully elucidated. It is herein hypothesized that zinc ions impede the first stages of silicate oligomerization (Si–O–Al), culminating in longer setting times. Pumping time measurements showed that Zn(NO3)2 delayed the setting time by 5 h in comparison to the zinc-less sample. DFT calculations revealed Si(OH)4 to react with [Zn(OH)4]2− via a barrierless transition state, evidencing a kinetic ground for the retardation effect. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy corroborated the DFT results by showing that Q3 species in the proposed mechanism are formed more rapidly in the presence of zinc ions than in its absence.",

            "abstract": "Cyclic tungsten bis-alkyne complexes derived from a 1,1′-ferrocenyldialkyne (1 and 2) adopt a rigid conformation where the two alkynes are in a syn orientation and are likely positioned about 3.5 Å apart. Since intramolecular hydrogen bonding in protein secondary structures positions the donors and acceptors 3.3 Å apart, it is proposed that linking two peptides to the two alkynes in one of these complexes might be a way to generate a model system for generating peptide β-sheets. To explore this question, a series of peptide derivatives of 1 were prepared. Attachment of peptides to the bimetallic ring system was achieved by reaction of peptide derivatives of 4-iodobenzoic acid or 4-iodoaniline with 1 via a Sonogashira coupling. Subsequent reaction of these dialkynes with W(CO)3(dmtc)2 (dmtc = dimethylditiocarbamate) afforded the desired cyclic tungsten bis-alkyne complexes as a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers. The two diastereomers were not separable using typical chromatographic methods (TLC, HPLC and flash chromatography); however, their presence and relative amounts could be detected and measured in the 1H NMR spectra. The conformations of these peptide derivatives of 1 were examined using NMR and DFT methods. It was found that appending the peptides to the two alkynes did not alter the rigid conformation of the ferrocene-tungsten bis-alkyne ring system found in 1; the ring system remained rigid and retained the intramolecular hydrogen bond across the bimetallic ring system. Whether the amide and urethane NH protons in these complexes are involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonds was explored using a DMSO titration experiment and computational methods. Data from the DMSO titrations showed that there was only one robust intramolecular hydrogen bond, the hydrogen bond across the bimetallic ring; the other amide and urethane NH protons were accessible to the solvent. The DFT calculations showed the peptides attached to the bimetallic ring system can adopt a number of different orientations having similar energies, and that some of these conformations include cross-strand hydrogen bonds. The data indicate that appending peptides to the bimetallic ring system via the two alkynes produces molecules where the two peptides are held in a parallel arrangement.",

By increasing intermolecular interaction of silica precursor, peptides can induce the formation of biosilica usually under neutral and basic but not acidic conditions, and here, they are defined as silica-forming peptides (SFPs). In addition, the silica-forming capability of most putative SFPs has not been evaluated. To address both questions, we developed molecular descriptors to simulate and predict the silica-forming capabilities of SFPs under a wide range of pH values. We used van der Waals and electrostatic interactions as molecular descriptors to probe the physisorption between amino acid residues and proto-silicate. We then performed multiple-dimensional simulations using the canonical R5 peptide and three novel SFPs from the brown alga Sargassum fusiforme. Finally, we experimentally validated the silica-forming capability of the four SFPs at pH values from 4 to 8. Our results showed that the molecular descriptors provide accurate predictions on the adsorption of proto-silicate by SFPs. Thus, the method can be used to screen SFPs that are capable of inducing the formation of silica in a wide pH range more importantly including acidic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Dyes presenting electron–accepting nitrophenyl and electron–donating phenolate groups have been used in the recent years as solvatochromic probes to investigate the polarity of solvents. Although several substituents in the phenolate have been used in studies involving these dyes, the use of tert-butyl groups has not yet been explored for these compounds. Bulky tert–butyl groups in the structure of these probes could bring interesting results because they make the dyes more lipophilic and hinder the formation of hydrogen bonds with hydrogen bond donating solvents. In this study, eight 2,6–di–tert–butylphenols were synthesized and characterized. They were then deprotonated to generate the corresponding phenolate dyes, which exhibited reverse solvatochromism. TD/DFT calculations were performed, being shown that the longest wavelength absorption bands of the dyes are due to π−π* transitions, with an intramolecular charge transfer from the 2,6–di–tert–butylphenolate to the 4–nitrophenyl group. Data indicated that the overall nature of the excitation is the same in all cases, and the differences registered between experimental and theoretical data suggest that a synergetic effect in the solvation of the probes involving many solvent molecules may take place, which can widen the gap between HOMO and LUMO. The tert–butyl groups play an important role in the nature of dye–solvent interactions. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the effect of the tert–butyl groups in hindering hydrogen bonding between the phenolate group and methanol and water solvent molecules, with a more structured solvation shell being observed on the nitro substituent of the probes. In conclusion, the investigation carried out showed that the presence of tert–butyl groups in the electron–donor phenolate groups tunes the types of interactions between the probe and the solvent. This can occur through changes in the molecular and electronic structure of the probe or be a result of steric hindrance, which makes the interaction of the solvent with the oxygen of the donor phenolate group more difficult.",

            "abstract": "Boron dipyrrins, otherwise known as BODIPY, are an actively investigated group of fluorescent dyes. Their main appeal comes from the variance of their spectral properties with substitution. In this work, we focus on a series of different meso-substituted BODIPY dyes. We tested the effect of substituents on the structure and spectroscopic properties of BODIPY. The following substitutes were examined: pentil, 4-dibutylaminophenyl, phenyl, 3,5-dimethylphenyl, 4-hydroxyphenyl, 4-dihydroxyphenyl, 4-carboxyphenyl, 4-dimethylaminophenyl, 4-dibutylaminophenyl, biphenyl, 9-anthryl, 2-thiophenyl and 2-furanyl. At the same time, higher prospects for directional changing in the optical properties of BODIPYs through the addition of aryl groups in position 3 were noted. An investigation of vibrationally-resolved absorption and emission spectra is presented. Subset of compounds was used to compare the most and the least involved (adiabatic hessian and vertical gradient respectively) models and have shown the wider applicability and better accuracy in experimental reproduction of the latter.",

The global minimum structures of the two diastereomers were assigned. It is found that chirality recognition leads to different compromises in the fine balance between intermolecular interactions. While one isomer features a stronger hydrogen bond, the other one is more tightly arranged and stabilized by larger London dispersion interactions. These new spectroscopic results help understand the influence of chirality in molecular aggregation and unveil the kind of interactions involved between a chiral alcohol and a chiral ketone with large dispersion contributions.",

The relative energy-level alignment between contacting semiconductors determinately affects the heterointerface charge injection and extraction dynamics. For perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the heterointerface between the top perovskite surface and a charge-transporting material is often treated for defect passivation1–4 to improve the PSC stability and performance. However, such surface treatments can also affect the heterointerface energetics1. Here we show that surface treatments may induce a negative work function shift (that is, more n-type), which activates halide migration to aggravate PSC instability. Therefore, despite the beneficial effects of surface passivation, this detrimental side effect limits the maximum stability improvement attainable for PSCs treated in this way. This trade-off between the beneficial and detrimental effects should guide further work on improving PSC stability via surface treatments.",

Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine-membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]−C≡C−B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)−CH=CH−B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 27 kcal mol−1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl- and alkynyl-P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.",

Here we show the assembly of a C64 nanographene derivative (comprising a planar core decorated with four meta-terphenyl–imide moieties at its periphery) into multilayer stacks with smaller PAHs ranging from naphthalene to ovalene and hexabenzocoronene. The functionalized C64 nanographene serves as a ditopic host that can accommodate a smaller PAH on either side of its planar core, in cavities delimited by its bulky imide substituents. Bilayers and trilayers (that is, complexes with 1:1 and 1:2 host:guest ratios, respectively) were observed in solution, and dimers of these complexes as well as multilayer compounds were isolated in the solid state. Quantum-chemical calculations indicate that dispersion forces are the main stabilizing factor for these complexes.",

Owing to the lack of exploitable stereocontrol elements in synthetic systems, steering the absolute and relative stereochemistry of free-radical processes is notoriously difficult in asymmetric catalysis. Inspired by the innate redox properties of first-row transition-metal cofactors, we repurposed cytochromes P450 to catalyze stereoselective atom-transfer radical cyclization. A set of metalloenzymes was engineered to impose substantial stereocontrol over the radical addition step and the halogen rebound step in these unnatural processes, allowing enantio- and diastereodivergent radical catalysis. This evolvable metalloenzyme platform represents a promising solution to tame fleeting radical intermediates for asymmetric catalysis.",

MCM-41 and SBA-15 with NM located in mesopores or on the external surface were prepared and characterized by TEM. 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to quantify arylphosphines in complexes with NM. Phosphine/NM ratios drop from 2.0 to 0.2 when increasing the probe diameter from 1.08 to 1.54 nm. The reaction between NM and triphenylphosphine (TPP) within 3.0 nm MCM-41 pores takes due to confinement effects multiple weeks. In contrast, external NM react with TPP instantly. A promising method is filling the pores by using the pore volume impregnation technique with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). TPP loading revealed that 66 % of NMs are located on the external surface of MCM-41. The pore filling method can be used in association with any probe molecule, also for the quantification of acid sites.",

Dispersion forces are a ubiquitous phenomenon with significant implications for chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. Admittedly, the dispersion interactions are considered “weak”. For this reason, the quantification of the dispersion forces is rather challenging. In this paper we used the DFT methodology with def2-TZVPP basis set to evaluate dispersion interactions in molecular and ionic systems. We also quantify the dispersion contributions with help of the complementary to DFT experimental methods based on thermochemical quantities: standard molar vaporization enthalpy and the ideal-gas standard molar enthalpy of formation. We used a bunch of experimental thermodynamic methods (combustion calorimetry, solution calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetry, vapour pressure determination with combined Quartz Crystal Microbalance, Knudsen method, transpiration technique, static method) to quantify the dispersion forces in molecular and ionic systems. Experimental studies have been performed on the well-chosen sets of molecular compounds (alkanes, alcohols, amines, aromatics) and ionic liquids (ammonium and phosphonium based ionic liquids). The main idea was based on the predominant view that bulky groups in molecular structures are more likely considered repulsive rather than stabilizing. In view of the fact that a delicate balance between attraction and repulsion can be quantified and rationalized, the approach developed in this work can help establish new design principles based on the conscious inclusion of dispersion as an important stabilizing factor. The ensemble of experimental techniques and quantum chemical methods (DFT with D3 dispersion correction) enabled the development of quantitative scales of the dispersion contributions and their understanding at the molecular level.",

To expand the molecular design synthetic strategies for triazole systems, it was suggested that the weakening of the basicity of the guanidine fragment via the introduction of a phenyl ring from one side and addition of a flexible 3-(carboxymethyl)sulfanyl moiety in position 3 of the cycle can lead to the formation of a triazole compound that would attach a proton on the nitrogen atom in the second position of the ring. Synthesis of the model 3-[(carboxymethyl)sulfanyl]-4-phenyl-5-phenylamino-4H-1,2,4-triazole via the selective S-alkylation of known 4-phenyl-5-phenylamino-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione has been performed. The synthesized triazole amino acid was converted into a corresponding hexabromotellurate salt which has been further explored and characterized via DFT, NMR and XRD methods.",

However, double bond isomers are not routinely distinguished by classical mass spectrometry workflows. Instead, they require sophisticated analytical approaches usually based on chemical derivatization and/or instrument modification. In this work, a novel strategy to investigate fatty acid double bond isomers (18:1) without prior chemical treatment or modification of the ion source was implemented by non-covalent adduct formation in the gas phase. Fatty acid adducts with sodium, pyridinium, trimethylammonium, dimethylammonium, and ammonium cations were characterized by a combination of cryogenic gas-phase infrared spectroscopy, ion mobility-mass spectrometry, and computational modeling. The results reveal subtle differences between double bond isomers and confirm three-dimensional geometries constrained by non-covalent ion-molecule interactions. Overall, this study on fatty acid adducts in the gas phase explores new avenues for the distinction of lipid double bond isomers and paves the way for further investigations of coordinating cations to increase resolution.",

            "abstract": "An analysis of the effects induced by F, Cl, and Br-substituents at the α-position of both, the hydroxyl or the amino group for a series of amino-alcohols, HOCH2(CH2)nCH2NH2 (n = 0–5) on the strength and characteristics of their OH···N or NH···O intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IMHBs) was carried out through the use of high-level G4 ab initio calculations. For the parent unsubstituted amino-alcohols, it is found that the strength of the OH···N IMHB goes through a maximum for n = 2, as revealed by the use of appropriate isodesmic reactions, natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and atoms in molecules (AIM), and non-covalent interaction (NCI) procedures. The corresponding infrared (IR) spectra also reflect the same trends. When the α-position to the hydroxyl group is substituted by halogen atoms, the OH···N IMHB significantly reinforces following the trend H < F < Cl < Br. Conversely, when the substitution takes place at the α-position with respect to the amino group, the result is a weakening of the OH···N IMHB. A totally different scenario is found when the amino-alcohols HOCH2(CH2)nCH2NH2 (n = 0–3) interact with BeF2. Although the presence of the beryllium derivative dramatically increases the strength of the IMHBs, the possibility for the beryllium atom to interact simultaneously with the O and the N atoms of the amino-alcohol leads to the global minimum of the potential energy surface, with the result that the IMHBs are replaced by two beryllium bonds.",

As a result of reaction condition screening, the Ni(0)/IAd (1,3-Di(1-adamantyl)imidazole-2-ylidene) system was found to be optimal for catalytic conversion. Interestingly, the reaction exclusively gives 3-acylbenzo[b]furan instead of a decarbonylated product frequently observed in reactions mediated by acyl-nickel species. The catalyst loadings could be reduced to 5–10 mol %. We demonstrated the synthesis of a variety of functionalized 3-acylbenzofuran derivatives. We conducted stoichiometric study of nickel complexes as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations to support a possible reaction mechanism.",

Rational design of trityl-based spin labels has enabled studying biomolecular structures at room temperature and within cells. However, most current trityl spin labels suffer either from aggregation with proteins due to their hydrophobicity, or from bioconjugation groups not suitable for in-cell measurements. Therefore, we introduce here the highly hydrophilic trityl spin label Ox-SLIM. Engineered as a short-linked maleimide, it combines the most recent developments in one single molecule, as it does not aggregate with proteins, exhibits high resistance under in-cell conditions, provides a short linker, and allows for selective and efficient spin labelling via cysteines. Beyond establishing synthetic access to Ox-SLIM, its suitability as a spin label is illustrated and ultimately, highly sensitive PDS measurements are presented down to protein concentrations as low as 45 nm resolving interspin distances of up to 5.5 nm.",

The reaction proceeds by catalysis in single-electron steps. The oxidative addition comprises an epoxide opening. An H-atom transfer, to generate a benzylic radical, serves as a radical translocation step, and an organometallic oxygen rebound as a reductive elimination. The reaction mechanism was studied by high-level dispersion corrected hybrid functional DFT with implicit solvation. The low-energy conformational space was searched by the efficient CREST program. The stereoselectivity was deduced from the lowest lying benzylic radical structures and their conformations are controlled by hyperconjugative interactions and steric interactions between the titanocene catalyst and the aryl groups of the substrate. An interesting mechanistic aspect is that the oxidation of the benzylic center occurs under reducing conditions.",

The examination of EPR spectra of radicals in organic solvents augmented with DFT calculations brought valuable information on the conformational dynamics and spin exchange mechanisms. Cyclic voltammetry investigations revealed (quasi)reversible electrochemical behaviour of studied nitroxides with their half-wave potentials ranging from −51 to −17 mV. SQUID measurements of selected radicals revealed that the magnetism of di- and trinitroxides is significantly different, since antiferromagnetic coupling in biradicals is notably larger than in triradicals. The single-crystal X-ray analysis of selected biradicals revealed the existence of 3D supramolecular networks of molecules linked through hydrogen-bonding interactions. These polynitroxide radicals can serve as promising bridging or chelating ligands in the synthesis of transition-metal-based molecular magnets.",

Because of their long wavelength of absorption, they can be effectively excited by taking advantage of therapeutic window of human tissues. Herein we report the repeat of the synthesis of two vinylthiophene-substituted derivatives with extended π-electron systems and their computational investigation. Those dyes were prepared starting from methyl-substituted ones via addition reaction of aldehyde-containing thiophene following the literature. Obtained experimental and theoretical data will allow us to design promising tools not only for cell imaging, but also for fluorescent detection of heavy cations via coordination and possibly more.",

Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is a nondestructive analytical technique that can be performed in the open air. In this study, reflection and transmission SE measurement data were combined to model the optical function of SU-8 photoresist. The data were fit using three different models: (i) a B-spline model, (ii) a four-Gaussian oscillator model with an ultraviolet (UV) and an infrared (IR) pole, and (iii) a Cody–Lorentz model with three additional Gaussian oscillators. All three models successfully fit the data, where the B-spline model showed the lowest mean squared error. In situ SE data were also collected and fitted to follow possible changes in the optical properties of the SU-8 during its development. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) modeling of a complete SU-8 monomer is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the measured optical function.",

It binds to glycans at the surface of epithelial cells and initiates infection. This process can be blocked by synthetic carbohydrates that mimic the structure of cell surface glycans. Herein we report the evaluation of a series of divalent glycosides featuring aromatic (benzene, squaramide) and bicyclic aliphatic (norbornene) scaffolds, with the latter being the first examples of their kind as small molecule anti-adhesion glycoconjugates. Galactosides 1 and 6, built on an aromatic core, were most efficient inhibitors of adhesion of C. albicans to buccal epithelial cells, displacing up to 36% and 48%, respectively, of yeast already attached to epithelial cells at 138 μM. Remarkably, cis-endo-norbornene 21 performed comparably to benzene-core derivatives. Conformational analysis reveals a preference for compounds 1 and 21 to adopt folded conformations. These results highlight the potential of norbornenes as a new class of aliphatic scaffolds for the synthesis of anti-adhesion compounds.",

            "abstract": "Due to the increasing pollution produced by the textile industry, environmentally friendly methods are becoming extremely important. In this work, silk fabrics (SFs) were modified with a series of natural polyphenols under the catalysis of laccase and then reacted with a ferrous solution to construct fabric surfaces with a micro-nano structure. Among the modified SFs, dopamine-Fe-modified silk fabric (PDA-Fe-SF) had an outstanding hydrophobicity and was screened as a research model. The preparation process was simple and eco-friendly, as it did not use toxic organic solvents, fluorine-containing substances, or halogen-containing and phosphorus-containing flame retardants. The structure and properties of the modified silk fabrics were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a vertical combustion test and so on. The results showed the surface of the PDA-Fe-SF was coated with dense and uniform needle-like γ-FeOOH nanorods and had a high contact angle (CA) of up to 165° and good self-cleaning performance. The damaged carbon length of the burned fabric was only 10.5 cm in the vertical combustion test, and the UPF value of the PDA-Fe-SF can reach 72, which classifies this material in the Excellent UV protection level. The modified silk fabrics had good mechanical properties and durability. Through the electrostatic potential analyses of polyphenols and their oligomers, the FeOOH formation mechanism of the surface morphology could reveal that the differences in the polymerization types, structures and water solubilities of the polyphenol polymers would affect the way in which the polymers deposit and the amount of deposition that occurs, and the number of coordination sites for Fe2+ and the resulting various surface morphologies on the silk fabric could be determined.",

The metalloradicals exhibit reduced stability in THF, decreasing in the order palladium(I) > platinum(I) and PAd3 > PtBu3, especially in the case of [Pt(PtBu3)2]+, which is converted into a 1:1 mixture of the platinum(II) complexes [Pt(PtBu2CMe2CH2)(PtBu3)]+ and [Pt(PtBu3)2H]+ upon dissolution at room temperature. Cyclometalation of [Pt(PtBu3)2]+ can also be induced by reaction with the 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylphenoxyl radical in DFB, and a common radical rebound mechanism involving carbon-to-metal H-atom transfer and formation of an intermediate platinum(III) hydride complex, [Pt(PtBu2CMe2CH2)H(PtBu3)]+, has been substantiated by computational analysis. Radical C–H bond oxidative addition is correlated with the resulting MII–H bond dissociation energy (M = Pt > Pd), and reactions of the metalloradicals with 9,10-dihydroanthracene in DFB at room temperature provide experimental evidence for the proposed C–H bond activation manifold in the case of platinum, although conversion into platinum(II) hydride derivatives is considerably faster for [Pt(PtBu3)2]+ (t1/2 = 1.2 h) than [Pt(PAd3)2]+ (t1/2 ∼ 40 days).",

Mayr’s approach to quantifying chemical reactivity has greatly facilitated the planning process, but reactivity parameters for new compounds require time-consuming experiments. In the past decade, data-driven modeling has been gaining momentum in the field, as it shows promise in terms of efficient reactivity prediction. However, state-of-the-art models use quantum chemical data as input, which prevent access to real-time planning in organic synthesis. Here, we present a novel data-driven workflow for predicting reactivity parameters of molecules that takes only structural information as input, enabling de facto real-time reactivity predictions. We use the well-understood chemical space of benzhydrylium ions as an example to demonstrate the functionality of our approach and the performance of the resulting quantitative structure–reactivity relationships (QSRRs). Our results suggest that it is straightforward to build low-cost QSRR models that are accurate, interpretable, and transferable to unexplored systems within a given scope of application. Moreover, our QSRR approach suggests that Hammett σ parameters are only approximately additive.",

The objective of this work is to study and understand the fundamental interactions between cholinium chloride and urea that lead to the experimentally observed melting temperature depression. To do so, the structure of urea was strategically and progressively modified, in order to block certain interaction centres, and the solid–liquid equilibrium data of each new binary system was experimentally measured. Using this approach, it was concluded that the most important interaction between cholinium chloride and urea occurs through hydrogen bonding between the chloride anion and the amine groups. Any blockage of these groups severely hampers the melting point depression effect. Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations were utilized to study in more detail this hydrogen bonding and its nuances.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic hyperbranched polyamideamine was carboxylated using succinic anhydride and modified further with 1-octyl-3-methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate successively. The morphology and chemical composition of the prepared material was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett-Teller measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, etc. 1-Octyl-3-methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate modified magnetic hyperbranched polyamideamine was used as sorbent in the magnetic solid-phase extraction for the separation and enrichment of five pyrethroid insecticides from tea infusion. The magnetic solid-phase extraction method proposed in this article has low method detection limits (0.53–0.71 ng/mL), acceptable coefficient of determination (0.9992–0.9998), wide linear ranges (2.5–500.0 ng/mL), and good repeatability (intraday: 1.2–6.3%; interday: 1.6–5.4%). In the detection of five pyrethroid insecticides in tea infusion, relative recoveries were in the range from 87.7 to 114.7% with satisfactory relative standard deviations (0.2–7.4%). With the aid of quantum chemistry calculations, the interaction energy between the sorbent and five pyrethroid insecticides was calculated, which proved the necessity of the modification of 1-octyl-3-methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies reported that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) could inhibit and enhance the phase separation in prion-like proteins. The molecular mechanism underlying such a puzzling phenomenon remains elusive. Here, taking the fused in sarcoma (FUS) solution as an example, we comprehensively reveal the underlying mechanism by which ATP regulates phase separation by combining the semiempirical quantum mechanical method, mean-field theory, and molecular simulation. At the microscopic level, ATP acts as a bivalent or trivalent binder; at the macroscopic level, the reentrant phase separation occurs in dilute FUS solutions, resulting from the ATP concentration–dependent binding ability under different conditions. The ATP concentration for dissolving the protein condensates is about 10 mM, agreeing with experimental results. Furthermore, from a dynamic point of view, the effect of ATP on phase separation is also nonmonotonic. This work provides a clear physical description of the microscopic interaction and macroscopic phase diagram of the ATP-modulated phase separation.",

Such investigations can help to extend the application of DBA materials to opto-electrochemical devices and no longer limit them to optical physics research. In this work, a series of new DBA materials, TACzs, for overcoming this limitation are reported. All TACzs show strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in their photoexcited states, leading to noticeable solvatochromism. Besides, the electronic structures of their radical anions show great variability, displaying different absorption spectra and diverse colors. Moreover, the potential application of TACzs as electrochromic and electro-fluorochromic materials are discussed. This work demonstrates that manipulating the π bridge between the donor and acceptor in the DBA system is an effective pathway not only to tailor the ICT properties of materials in their neutral state, but also to tune the absorption characteristics of their radical anion state, which makes them very promising for applications in electroluminescent and electrochemical devices.",

We introduced diiminium pyridine adducts as highly convenient and potent Lewis acids. We report that tributylphosphine selectively adds to the 4-position of pyridine in tetramethyldiiminium pyridine ditrifluoromethanesulfonate, resulting in the formation of the title compound. This finding represents an advancement towards the utilization of diiminium units as organic reagents or catalysts for pyridine functionalization. We also employ computational models to determine fluoride and hydride ion affinities, Fukui function f+(r), molecular electrostatic potential, and pKa values, providing valuable insights for future investigations in this area.",

            "abstract": "Topical chemotherapy approaches are relevant for certain skin cancer treatments. This study observes that cabazitaxel (CTX), a broad-spectrum second-generation taxane cytotoxic agent, can be dissolved in α-tocopherol at high concentrations exceeding 100 mg mL−1. 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) are used to study this phenomenon. The addition of 30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to the α-tocopherol/CTX solution improves its working viscosity and enhances CTX permeation through human skin in vitro (over 5 µg cm−2 within 24 h), while no detectable drug permeates when CTX is dissolved in α-tocopherol alone. In a transepidermal water loss assay, the barrier impairment induced by CTX in 30% DMSO in α-tocopherol, but not in pure DMSO, is reversible 8 h after the formulation removal from the skin surface. Antitumor efficacy of the topical CTX formulation is evaluated in nude mice bearing A431 human squamous carcinoma skin cancer xenografts. With topical application of concentrated CTX solutions (75 mg mL−1), tumor growth is significantly suppressed compared to lower concentration groups (0, 25, or 50 mg mL−1 CTX). Taken together, these findings show that topical delivery of CTX using a DMSO and α-tocopherol solvent warrants further study as a treatment for skin malignancies.",

In the present study we have performed computations to identify the reaction mechanism of the formation of these intermediates and to address important reactivity issues. We have contrasted the effect of two typical phosphine ligands (P = PCy3, PPh2Me), which show different behaviors according to two recent but separate experimental reports. We have also considered different experimental (stoichiometric and catalytic) conditions to elucidate the corresponding experimental observations. The free energy profiles of the most likely mechanisms supported the more facile formation of the transmetalation-active catalytic intermediate with PPh2Me and also justified why the intermediate of the oxidative addition cannot be observed for this ligand. A crucial ingredient of the mechanisms is the cis–trans rearrangement in the square-planar ligand structure around the Ni(II) center to stabilize the complexes and to facilitate the Ni insertion preceding the decarbonylation. We obtained two distinct pathways for this rearrangement: either a square-planar–tetrahedral conformational transition or a route through five-coordinated, more fluxional configurations, depending on the phosphines. In fact, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the mobile trigonal-bipyramidal structures can remarkably simplify the decarbonylation mechanism predicted by optimization calculations, implying an even faster decarbonylation.",

The interaction mechanism between NTO and AP is important for the feasibility of combining these materials and can provide theoretical guidance for the design of such a combination. Thus, in order to figure out the interaction mechanism between NTO and AP on multiple scales, density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) studies have been carried out. Several possible configurations are obtained from a large number of randomly generated NTO and AP dimers using DFT. To understand the interaction mechanism, binding energies, energy decomposition, electrostatic potential (ESP), electron density topology, and independent gradient model based on the Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) analyses were carried out. To have further insights into the combination of NTO and AP, the AIMD method was used to predict the co-crystal structure of NTO and AP, and the electron structure, thermal decomposition, and shock Hugoniot curves were calculated. All the calculation results show the high feasibility of the combination of NTO and AP to form NTO/AP co-crystal with excellent performance.",

The role of water in salt particle formation is not fully understood as it can stabilize or destabilize cluster structures, which leads to non-linear effects on cluster formation dynamics. In the studied systems, increased relative humidity can enhance the particle formation for up to four orders of magnitude in the case of nitric acid, but it can also slightly reduce the particle formation in the cases of sulfuric acid and methanesulfonic acid. As the effect of relative humidity in salt particle formation varies many orders of magnitude depending on the acid and base molecules, neglecting hydration or using the same value for different systems may introduce remarkable inaccuracies in large-scale models.",

In this study, both time-resolved electronic and IR spectroscopy have been applied to investigate excited state relaxation processes competing with fission in dimers of DPP derivatives with varying linker structures. A charge-separated (CS) state is shown to be an important intermediate with dynamics that are both solvent and linker dependent. The CS state is found for a subset of the total population of excited molecules and it is proposed that CS state formation requires suitably aligned dimers within a broader distribution of conformations available in solution. No long-lived triplet signatures indicative of singlet fission were detected, with the CS state likely acting as an alternative relaxation pathway for the excitation energy. This study provides insight into the role of molecular conformation in determining excited state relaxation pathways in DPP dimer systems.",

This acid is a derivative of mandelic acid and is used in various organic reactions. The conformational landscape of alpha-methoxy phenylacetic acid was explored to gain insight into its intramolecular dynamics. A rich rotational spectrum was obtained using chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy in the 2–8 GHz range. Five conformers out of six calculated low-energy forms were identified in the spectrum, and the assignment of the 13C singly substituted isotopologues for the lowest-energy conformer led to its accurate structure determination. Splitting patterns were analyzed and attributed to the internal rotation of a methyl top. The analysis of the non-covalent interactions within the molecule highlights the subtle balance in the stabilization of the different conformers. We thus provide high-level structural and intramolecular dynamics information that is also used to benchmark the performance of quantum-chemical calculations.",

In this study, a novel benzothiazole-rofecoxib-based luminogen, o-RBZ, was constructed by integrating the benzothiazole unit into the rofecoxib scaffold. It showed an obvious AIE property, which was investigated and elucidated clearly by systematic experimental and theoretical research. According to single-crystal X-ray and Hirshfeld surface analysis, the highly twisted structure of o-RBZ and restricted-stacking may allow for bright emission in the solid state. Meanwhile, the theoretical calculation revealed that small oscillator strengths (f = 0.06) and a large root mean square deviation (RMSD) were mainly responsible for the large non-radiative transition rate and the suppression of luminous efficacy in DMSO. Furthermore, o-RBZ displayed apparent solvatochromism, mechanochromism, and lipid droplets-specific imaging properties (Pearson's correlative coefficient value of 0.94, low cell cytotoxicity). These findings suggest that AIE-active o-RBZ has the potential to be developed as a multi-functional material for mechanical-force sensors and lipid droplets imaging probes.",

The standard mechanism used to incorporate chemical element information is to create separate densities for each element and form tensor products between them. This leads to a steep scaling in the size of the representation as the number of elements increases. Graph neural networks, which do not explicitly use density representations, escape this scaling by mapping the chemical element information into a fixed dimensional space in a learnable way. By exploiting symmetry, we recast this approach as tensor factorization of the standard neighbour-density-based descriptors and, using a new notation, identify connections to existing compression algorithms. In doing so, we form compact tensor-reduced representation of the local atomic environment whose size does not depend on the number of chemical elements, is systematically convergable, and therefore remains applicable to a wide range of data analysis and regression tasks.",

A novel biochar/2Zn3In2S6/WO3 (BC/2ZIS/WO3) photocatalyst was synthesized by the hydrothermal method, which has synergistic performance of adsorption and photocatalysis. BC, the carrier of the ZIS/WO3 heterojunction, with a large specific surface area (1161.25 m2/g), good electrical conductivity, improved the efficiency of catalyst charge separation, and significantly enhanced the photocatalytic performance. The adsorption isotherm experiment showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of the BC/2ZIS/WO3 for MB and RhB was 120.04 and 466.55 mg/g, respectively. Under the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis, the removal rates of MB and RhB reached 80.5% and 99%, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the single heterojunction. Furthermore, through DFT calculations, trapping experiments, and HPLC-MS, the adsorption, degradation mechanism and pathways were elaborated. In general, this work provided important insights into the role of biochar in improving the photocatalytic degradation of pollutants, and guided the design of environment-friendly photocatalysts in the future.",

Extensive density functional theory calculations performed in this work predict the mononuclear walnut-like Ci C50B54 (1) (C2B10@C48B44), C1 C50B54 (2) (CB11@C49B43), and S10 C50B54 (3) (B12@C50B42) which contain one icosahedral-CnB12-n core (n = 0, 1, 2) at the center following the Wade’s skeletal electron counting rules and the approximately electron sufficient binuclear peanut-like Cs C88B78 (4) ((C2B10)2@C84B58), Cs C88B78 (5) ((CB11)2@C86B56), Cs C88B78 (6) ((B12)2@C88B54), Cs B180 (7) ((B12)2@B156), Cs B182 (8) ((B12)2@B158), and Cs B184 (9) ((B12)2@B160) which encapsulate two interconnected CnB12-n icosahedrons inside. These novel core–shell borafullerene and borospherene nanoclusters appear to be the most stable species in thermodynamics in the corresponding cluster size ranges reported to date. Detailed bonding analyses indicate that the icosahedral B122−, CB11−, and C2B10 cores in these core–shell structures possess the superatomic electronic configuration of 1S21P61D101F8, rendering spherical aromaticity and extra stability to the systems. Such superatomic icosahedral-CnB12-n stuffed borafullerenes and borospherenes with spherical aromaticity may serve as embryos to form bulk boron allotropes and their carbon-boron binary counterparts in bottom-up approaches.",

            "abstract": "Cocrystallization is a helpful method for explosives design. However, lack of understanding of the cocrystallization mechanism leads to inefficiency in cocrystal preparation. Therefore, studying the effects of solvent on cocrystal is of great importance for the efficient application of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20). In this paper, the effect of solvent on cocrystallization is investigated by the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent cluster model, the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture model, the CL-20/HMX cocrystal/solvent interface model combined with quantum chemistry and molecular dynamic methods. The authors find that the hydrogen bond between CL-20 and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) is the strongest and the binding energy of cocrystal and solvent molecules is the weakest in ethyl acetate (EA) solvent, indicating that CL-20 and HMX tend to be combined together and there is less hindrance by solvent molecules. Analysis of the CL-20/HMX/solvent mixture and mass density distribution studies show that the solvent effect has a great influence on the crystal faces and the cocrystallization rate of CL-20 and HMX is the highest in EA solvent. The XRD and SEM characterization results are consistent with the theoretical calculations. The present work on the effects of solvent on CL-20/HMX cocrystals is beneficial for understanding the mechanism of the growth of energetic cocrystal materials. It is helpful in selecting more suitable theoretical and experimental conditions and makes access to excellent cocrystals more efficient.",

The structures and energies of the IL clusters, predicted with global optimization, agree with and help interpret the ion abundances and stabilities measured by high-mass-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and collision-induced dissociation experiments. The [EMIM][BF4]2– cluster, which was identified as the most stable IL cluster, was selectively soft-landed onto a working electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed a lower charge transfer resistance on the soft-landed electrode containing [EMIM][BF4]2– compared with an electrode prepared by drop-casting of an IL solution containing the full range of IL clusters. Our findings indicate that specific IL clusters may be used to increase the efficiency of electrochemical separations by lowering the overpotentials involved.",

            "abstract": "The extraction of pertechnetate (TcO4−) and perrhenate (ReO4−) by tributyl phosphate (TBP) has been extensively studied, but the structure of the extracted species is subject to debate. In this work, the extraction behavior of TcO4− and ReO4− from both HNO3 and HCl media by TBP in n-dodecane was studied by examining the effects of acid concentration, extractant concentration, and temperature on the extraction. The two anions displayed similar extraction behavior in both the HNO3 and HCl systems, where the distribution ratio of TcO4− was slightly higher than that of ReO4−. The measurement of water content in the organic phase and dynamic light scattering were carried out, which in combination with the extraction behavior indicated that ReO4− was extracted as [H+ReO4−(H2O)8·(TBP)4] and formed microemulsions in the organic phase. Theoretical calculations were performed on the structure of both [H+ReO4−(H2O)8·(TBP)4] and [H+TcO4−(H2O)8·(TBP)4]. The TBP molecules interacted with the [H+ReO4−(H2O)8] and [H+TcO4−(H2O)8] clusters through hydrogen bonding between H2O and the O=P groups, i.e., ReO4− and TcO4− underwent outer-sphere coordination with TBP in the organic phase. Results in this work provide valuable insights into the structures of ReO4− and TcO4− extracted into the organic phase by TBP, and also assist in the analysis of TcO4− species in the PUREX process.",

Due to the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of the phase transition process, monitoring the structural changes of compounds during this process is challenging. In this work, a combining of the mass spectrometry-based method and quantum chemistry calculations was used to study the structural changes during liquid-to-gas phase transitions. Electrospray is used to induce the transition of phenolic acid molecules from the liquid phase to the gas phase. The deprotonated structures were captured and separated using ion mobility mass spectrometry. Deprotonated structures helped to identify the most acidic functional group within the molecule. These deprotonated structures were confirmed by collision-induced dissociation and molecular collision cross-section measurements. Quantum chemistry calculations revealed the mechanisms about the variation of intramolecular acid site and “kinetic trapping.” Three liquid-to-gas phase transformation models were proposed, demonstrating that the variation in free energy among different deprotonated structures governs the thermodynamic/kinetic process of the liquid-to-gas phase conversion.",

Due to the lack of experimental data and computational cost of high-level quantum chemistry methods, approximate methods based on additivity schemes and more recently machine learning are currently the only approaches capable of supplying the chemical coverage and throughput necessary for such applications. For both approaches, ring-containing molecules pose a challenge to transferability due to the nonlocal interactions associated with conjugation and strain that significantly impact thermodynamic properties. Here, we report the development of a self-consistent approach for parameterizing transferable ring corrections based on high-level quantum chemistry. The method is benchmarked against both the Pedley–Naylor–Kline experimental dataset for C-, H-, O-, N-, S-, and halogen-containing cyclic molecules and a dataset of Gaussian-4 quantum chemistry calculations. The prescribed approach is demonstrated to be superior to existing ring corrections while maintaining extensibility to arbitrary chemistries. We have also compared this ring-correction scheme against a novel machine learning approach and demonstrate that the latter is capable of exceeding the performance of physics-based ring corrections.",

In a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we studied the influence of the type, polarity, pore size and shape of the mesoporous material as well as of the aryl substituent at the diene, spacer type and lengths on asymmetric Rh diene catalysis under confinement. For this purpose, a library of novel chiral Rh norbornadiene complexes was immobilized on ordered mesoporous silica (OMS), ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) and non-templated mesoporous SiO2 materials with different pore sizes via azide–alkyne 1,3-dipolar click reaction. Among the different materials, Rh complexes immobilized on OMS performed best in the 1,2-addition of aryl boroxines to N-tosyl imines as a benchmark reaction. High yields were achieved when Rh complexes were connected to pore walls by unbranched linkers of medium lengths (dpore = 5.9 nm). Good enantioselectivities were obtained either by linear alkyl linkers in smaller pores (dpore = 4.9 nm) or branched aminoethanol linkers in larger pores (dpore = 6.8 nm). However, the largest confinement effect was caused by the aryl substituent at the diene moiety, giving up to e.r. 99 : 1 for 1-naphthyl. While complementary X-ray absorption experiments (EXAFS, XANES) could not distinguish between triazole and amide carbonyl coordination at Rh, computational studies supported the triazole coordination.",

            "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is routinely employed for structure elucidation of molecules. Structural information can be retrieved from intact molecular ions by fragmentation; however, the interpretation of fragment spectra is often hampered by poor understanding of the underlying dissociation mechanisms. For example, neutral headgroup loss from protonated glycerolipids has been postulated to proceed via an intramolecular ring closure but the mechanism and resulting ring size have never been experimentally confirmed. Here we use cryogenic gas-phase infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with computational chemistry to unravel the structures of fragment ions and thereby shed light on elusive dissociation mechanisms. Using the example of glycerolipid fragmentation, we study the formation of protonated five-membered dioxolane and six-membered dioxane rings and show that dioxolane rings are predominant throughout different glycerolipid classes and fragmentation channels. For comparison, pure dioxolane and dioxane ions were generated from tailor-made dehydroxyl derivatives inspired by natural 1,2- and 1,3-diacylglycerols and subsequently interrogated using IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the cyclic structure of an intermediate fragment occurring in the phosphatidylcholine fragmentation pathway was spectroscopically confirmed. Overall, the results contribute substantially to the understanding of glycerolipid fragmentation and showcase the value of vibrational ion spectroscopy to mechanistically elucidate crucial fragmentation pathways in lipidomics.",

            "abstract": "The geometry of a molecule plays a significant role in determining its physical and chemical properties. Despite its importance, there are relatively few studies on ring puckering and conformations, often focused on small cycloalkanes, 5- and 6-membered carbohydrate rings, and specific macrocycle families. We lack a general understanding of the puckering preferences of medium-sized rings and macrocycles. To address this, we provide an extensive conformational analysis of a diverse set of rings. We used Cremer–Pople puckering coordinates to study the trends of the ring conformation across a set of 140 000 diverse small molecules, including small rings, macrocycles, and cyclic peptides. By standardizing using key atoms, we show that the ring conformations can be classified into relatively few conformational clusters, based on their canonical forms. The number of such canonical clusters increases slowly with ring size. Ring puckering motions, especially pseudo-rotations, are generally restricted and differ between clusters. More importantly, we propose models to map puckering preferences to torsion space, which allows us to understand the inter-related changes in torsion angles during pseudo-rotation and other puckering motions. Beyond ring puckers, our models also explain the change in substituent orientation upon puckering. We also present a novel knowledge-based sampling method using the puckering preferences and coupled substituent motion to generate ring conformations efficiently. In summary, this work provides an improved understanding of general ring puckering preferences, which will in turn accelerate the identification of low-energy ring conformations for applications from polymeric materials to drug binding.",

In the context of Ni-catalyzed C(sp3)–O functionalization, we have developed a unique strategy employing activated cyclopropanols to aid the design and optimization of a redox-active leaving group for C(sp3)–O arylation. In this chemistry, the cyclopropane ring acts as a reporter of leaving-group reactivity, since the ring-opened product is obtained under polar (2e) conditions, and the ring-closed product is obtained under radical (1e) conditions. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the optimal leaving group is redox-active and are consistent with a Ni(I)/Ni(III) catalytic cycle. The optimized reaction conditions are also used to synthesize a number of arylcyclopropanes, which are valuable pharmaceutical motifs.",

The reactions employ two structurally and electronically very different in situ silylated enantiopure Lewis acid organocatalysts: i.e., binaphthyl-allyl-tetrasulfone (BALT) and imidodiphosphorimidate (IDPi). Each of these catalysts activates only specific substrates in an enantioselective fashion. Emphasis is placed on identifying and quantifying the key noncovalent interactions responsible for the selectivity of these transformations, with the final aim of aiding in the development of designing principles for catalysts with a broader scope. Our results shed light into the mechanism through which the catalyst architecture determines the selectivity of these transformations via a delicate balance of dispersion and steric interactions.",

Considering their success across a dizzying range of organocatalysts and organic transformations, it would seem unlikely that a common principle exists for their functioning. However, the current investigations with DFT suggest a general principle: the phenolic additive sandwiches itself, through hydrogen bonding and π⋅⋅⋅π stacking, between the organocatalyst coordinated electrophile and nucleophile. This is seen for a wide range of experimentally reported systems. That such complex formation leads to enhanced stereoselectivity is then demonstrated for two cases: the cinchona alkaloid complex (BzCPD), catalysing thiocyanation (2-naphthol additive employed), as well as for L-pipecolicacid catalysing the asymmetric nitroaldol reaction with a range of nitro-substituted phenol additives. These findings, indicating that dual catalysis takes place when phenolic additives are employed, are likely to have a significant impact on the field of asymmetric organocatalysis.",

            "abstract": "The design criteria needed for the formation of the sqc metal–organic framework (MOF) topology, from an 8-connecting node and a 4-connecting linker, are unclear due to a limited number of reports. After recently reporting the MOF UAM-1000 (UAM = University of Adelaide Material), which has this rare sqc topology, we present a study that explores the effect of flexible tetrapyrazole carboxylate linker structure metrics on the topology of Zirconium-based MOFs (Zr-MOFs). By modifying the linker length and width, three new Zr-MOFs (UAM-10, UAM-11, and UAM-1002) were synthesized and characterized. The study reveals that linker dimensions influence the accessible conformations, and along with fine-tuning of synthetic conditions, allow control over MOF topology. Additionally, linker flexibility plays a crucial role in the formation of the sqc over the more common csq topology. Finally, the presence of free bis-pyrazolyl groups in the reported MOFs allowed us to evaluate the potential for post-synthetic metalation (PSMet). UAM-10 and UAM-11 are too rigid, the pyrazole groups lack the appropriate arrangement and therefore these materials do not undergo PSMet. In contrast, UAM-1002 with its scu topology exhibits the right quanta of flexibility needed for successful PSMet, making it a promising platform for studying the chemistry of anchored organometallic complexes. Moreover, the different topology for UAM-1002 versus UAM-1000 changes the nature of the PSMet site (bidentate versus a tetradentate site) despite these being made from the same node and linker building blocks.",

To explore the possibility of enhancing the efficiency and stability of the catalyst, the synthesis of a galactose-derived trifluoromethyl ketone, and its use for stereoselective epoxidation reaction that exploits a transitory dioxirane as active species are herein reported. The trifluoromethyl ketone was built on the C6 of a protected d-galactopyranose. The organocatalyst was obtained smoothly in a few steps, and when utilized for stereoselective epoxidation exhibited excellent stability as no chemical alterations were observed during the reaction. The stereoselectivity, although sometimes moderate, appears surprisingly high considering the conformational freedom of the trifluoromethyl ketone moiety. DFT calculations were performed to investigate the interactions involved in regulating the observed selectivities. Moreover, a new mnemonic model has been developed to serve as a fast-predicting tool for epoxidation of new substrates.",

            "abstract": "Certain peptide sequences, some of them as short as amino acid triplets, are significantly overpopulated in specific secondary structure motifs in folded protein structures. For example, 74% of the EAM triplet is found in α-helices, and only 3% occurs in the extended parts of proteins (typically β-sheets). In contrast, other triplets (such as VIV and IYI) appear almost exclusively in extended parts (79% and 69%, respectively). In order to determine whether such preferences are structurally encoded in a particular peptide fragment or appear only at the level of a complex protein structure, NMR, VCD, and ECD experiments were carried out on selected tripeptides: EAM (denoted as pro-‘α-helical’ in proteins), KAM(α), ALA(α), DIC(α), EKF(α), IYI(pro-β-sheet or more generally, pro-extended), and VIV(β), and the reference α-helical CATWEAMEKCK undecapeptide. The experimental data were in very good agreement with extensive quantum mechanical conformational sampling. Altogether, we clearly showed that the pro-helical vs. pro-extended propensities start to emerge already at the level of tripeptides and can be fully developed at longer sequences. We postulate that certain short peptide sequences can be considered minimal “folding seeds”. Admittedly, the inherent secondary structure propensity can be overruled by the large intramolecular interaction energies within the folded and compact protein structures. Still, the correlation of experimental and computational data presented herein suggests that the secondary structure propensity should be considered as one of the key factors that may lead to understanding the underlying physico-chemical principles of protein structure and folding from the first principles.",

Here, polystyrene divinylbenzene microspheres (PS-DVB) were surface-modified by poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (poly-CBMA) through controlled polymerization, named PCBMA. PS-DVB served as a supporting backbone and provided enormous specific surface, while a layer of the poly-CBMA aimed at efficiently removing various toxins and attaining better biocompatibility. After modification, the mesoporous analysis revealed a high specific surface area of 527 m2/g. More notably, compared with PS-DVB, PCBMA showed an 830%, 130%, and 26% increase in the adsorption capacity of p-cresol sulfate (PCS), indoleacetic acid (IAA), and bilirubin (BR), respectively, in the presence of 40 g/L bovine serum albumin. Further molecular dynamics simulations and DFT calculations showed that poly-CBMA exhibited stronger intermolecular forces for all three toxins. The hydrogen bonds formed between the negatively charged carboxylate ions from PCBMA contributed to its excellent adsorption performance. This study not only provides a new idea to study the adsorption mechanism of toxins by zwitterionic polymers but also demonstrates the promising application of microspheres modified by zwitterionic polymers in clinical hemoperfusion therapy.",

Theoretically, two different pathways of solvation emerge: the commonly observed droplet pathway which involves preferential binding among the water molecules while the solute serves as an anchor point for the formation of a water cluster, and an unexpected wetting pathway which involves interactions between the water molecules and the aromatic face of MC, i.e., a wetting of the π-surface. Conclusive identification of the MC hydrate structures, and therefore the wetting pathway, was facilitated by rotational spectra of the parent MC hydrates and several H218O and 13C isotopologues which exhibit splittings associated with methyl internal rotation and/or water tunneling motions. Theoretical modelling and analyses offer insights into the tunneling and conversion barriers associated with the observed hydrate conformers and the nature of the non-covalent interactions involved in choosing the unusual wetting pathway.",

Even though the calculations were carried out for isolated molecules in the gas-phase limit, neglecting inter-molecular interactions and anharmonic effects, the match between simulated and experimental spectra is reasonable. We also study the influence of different density functionals on the conformational search and the resulting VCD spectra via group coupling matrices (GCMs). The GCM analysis reveals that the VCD signal can in some cases arise from moieties which are close to each other and in other cases from moieties far from each other. Differences in spectra obtained using different exchange–correlation density functionals can be attributed to interaction terms between different moieties in the molecules changing their sign.",

            "abstract": "A theoretical analysis of the potential inhibition of human sucrase-isomaltase (SI) by flavonoids was carried out with the aim of identifying potential candidates for an alternative treatment of type 2 diabetes. Two compounds from maize silks, maysin and luteolin, were selected to be studied with the structure-based density functional theory (DFT), molecular docking (MDock), and molecular dynamics (MD) approaches. The docking score and MD simulations suggested that the compounds maysin and luteolin presented higher binding affinities in N-terminal sucrase-isomaltase (NtSI) than in C-terminal sucrase-isomaltase (CtSI). The reactivity parameters, such as chemical hardness (η) and chemical potential (µ), of the ligands, as well as of the active site amino acids of the NtSI, were calculated by the meta-GGA M06 functional in combination with the 6-31G(d) basis set. The lower value of chemical hardness calculated for the maysin molecule indicated that this might interact more easily with the active site of NtSI, in comparison with the values of the acarbose and luteolin structures. Additionally, a possible oxidative process was proposed through the quantum chemical calculations of the electronic charge transfer values (∆N) between the active site amino acids of the NtSI and the ligands. In addition, maysin displayed a higher ability to generate more oxidative damage in the NtSI active site. Our results suggest that maysin and luteolin can be used to develop novel α-glucosidase inhibitors via NtSI inhibition.",

            "abstract": "The seventh pandemic of the diarrheal cholera disease, which began in 1960, is caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Its environmental persistence provoking recurring sudden outbreaks is enabled by V. cholerae’s rapid adaption to changing environments involving sensory proteins like ToxR and ToxS. Located at the inner membrane, ToxR and ToxS react to environmental stimuli like bile acid, thereby inducing survival strategies for example bile resistance and virulence regulation. The presented crystal structure of the sensory domains of ToxR and ToxS in combination with multiple bile acid interaction studies, reveals that a bile binding pocket of ToxS is only properly folded upon binding to ToxR. Our data proposes an interdependent functionality between ToxR transcriptional activity and ToxS sensory function. These findings support the previously suggested link between ToxRS and VtrAC-like co-component systems. Besides VtrAC, ToxRS is now the only experimentally determined structure within this recently defined superfamily, further emphasizing its significance. In-depth analysis of the ToxRS complex reveals its remarkable conservation across various Vibrio species, underlining the significance of conserved residues in the ToxS barrel and the more diverse ToxR sensory domain. Unravelling the intricate mechanisms governing ToxRS’s environmental sensing capabilities, provides a promising tool for disruption of this vital interaction, ultimately inhibiting Vibrio’s survival and virulence. Our findings hold far-reaching implications for all Vibrio strains that rely on the ToxRS system as a shared sensory cornerstone for adapting to their surroundings.",

Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work, the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexa-cationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non-aromatic peripheral substituents on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.",

The rapid and efficient degradation of HD is crucial to protect people from hurting by its high toxicity. However, the widely used water-based decontaminants always have limited degradation efficiency for HD due to its poor solubility in water. Therefore, ionic liquids (ILs) hold great potentials as solvents for degradation of HD since they can improve HD’s solubility for an effective degradation. In this study, the solubilities of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), a simulant of HD, in nine ionic liquids (ILs) were investigated. Interaction descriptors of the anions, cations, and ILs were computed using quantum mechanics and density functional theory to understand the influence of the IL properties on the solubility of CEES in ILs at the molecular level. The results indicate that CEES solubility depends on cation/anion physical properties and anion–cation and anion/cation/IL–CEES interactions. The cation electron affinity and anion ionization potential are closely related to the solubility of the Lewis acid CEES in the ILs. The anion/cation–CEES interaction energy (IE) exhibits poor correlation with CEES solubility, while the anion–cation IE plays a dominant role. A negative correlation was observed between absolute IL–CEES IEs and CEES solubility. For HCO3¯ anion-based ILs, the interstitial space of the ILs increased with the cationic alkyl side chain length within a specific limit, resulting in more excellent solubility of CEES. For [BMIm]+ cation-based ILs, the anion influenced the cation–anion and cation/anion/IL–CEES IEs, thus affecting the solubility of CEES. In conclusion, this study serves as a guide for designing ILs for dissolving CEES and improving the degradation efficiency of HD by exploring cation–anion and anion/cation/IL–CEES interactions and other interaction descriptors.",

The low temperatures achieved as well as the absence of environment effects allow for a direct comparison between computed and experimental spectra. This provides potential benchmarking data which can be revisited to hone different computational techniques, and it allows for the critical analysis of procedures under the setting of a blind challenge. In the latter case, the final result is unknown to modellers, providing an unbiased testing opportunity for quantum chemical models. In this work, we present the spectroscopic and computational results for the first HyDRA blind challenge. The latter deals with the prediction of water donor stretching vibrations in monohydrates of organic molecules. This edition features a test set of 10 systems. Experimental water donor OH vibrational wavenumbers for the vacuum-isolated monohydrates of formaldehyde, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, tetrahydrothiophene, trifluoroethanol, methyl lactate, dimethylimidazolidinone, cyclooctanone, trifluoroacetophenone and 1-phenylcyclohexane-cis-1,2-diol are provided. The results of the challenge show promising predictive properties in both purely quantum mechanical approaches as well as regression and other machine learning strategies.",

A safe and effective intracellular viscosity detecting method is desired by the biomedical community. Recently, a novel near-infrared fluorescent probe NI-VIS with a twisting intramolecular charge transfer mechanism was developed. The capability of this probe to visualize the viscosity variation in cirrhotic liver tissues and map the micro viscosity in vivo were testified using an experiment. In this work, the twisting intramolecular charge transfer mechanism and fluorescent properties of the probe NI-VIS were studied in detail under quantum mechanical method. The low energy barrier among the different conformations of the probe indicated the occurrence of twisting intramolecular charge transfer due to the rotation of the aryl group in the probe molecule while within the low viscosity environment. The electronic structure analysis on different probe conformations revealed the electron transfer process of the probe under optical excitation. All these theoretical results could provide insights into understand in greater depth the principles and build highly effective fluorescent probe to monitor the viscosity in biological samples.",

A significant achievement in this context is the asymmetric organocatalysis of the thiocyanation reaction. In the current study, computational studies with density functional theory have been done in order to understand an interesting experimental finding: the reversal of enantioselectivity from R to S when the electrophile is changed from β-keto ester to oxindole for the thiocyanation reaction with the cinchona alkaloid complex catalyst. The calculations reveal an unusual fact – the principal reason for the reversal is the presence of the C−H⋅⋅⋅S noncovalent interaction, which is present only in the major transition states in each of the two nucleophile cases. Only recently has it been realized that the supposedly weak C−H⋅⋅⋅S noncovalent interaction has the properties of a hydrogen bond, and the fact that this interaction is the cause of enantioselectivity has relevance, because of the large number of asymmetric transformations involving the sulphur heteroatom.",

            "abstract": "Multifunctional compounds may form different prototropic isomers under different conditions, which are known as protomers/deprotomers. In biological systems, these protomer/deprotomer isomers affect the interaction modes and conformational landscape between compounds and enzymes and thus present different biological activities. Study on protomers/deprotomers is essentially the study on the acidity/basicity of each intramolecular functional group and its effect on molecular structure. In recent years, the combination of mass spectrometry (MS) and computational chemistry has been proven to be a powerful and effective means to study prototropic isomers. MS-based technologies are developed to discriminate and characterize protomers/deprotomers to provide structural information and monitor transformations, showing great superiority than other experimental methods. Computational chemistry is used to predict the thermodynamic stability of protomers/deprotomers, provide the simulated MS/MS spectra, infrared spectra, and calculate collision cross-section values. By comparing the theoretical data with the corresponding experimental results, the researchers can not only determine the protomer/deprotomer structure, but also investigate the structure–activity relationship in a given system. This review covers various MS methods and theoretical calculations and their devotion to isomer discrimination, structure identification, conformational transformation, and phase transition investigation of protomers/deprotomers.",

It may well be argued, however, that a profound understanding of what truly defines a WCA is still lacking, and systematic studies to unravel counterion effects are scarce. In this work, we investigate a supramolecular pseudorotaxane formation reaction, subject to a selection of anions, ranging from strongly to weakly coordinating, which not only aids in fostering our knowledge about anion coordination properties, but also provides valuable theoretical insight into the nature of the mechanical bond. We employ state-of-the-art DFT-based methods and tools, combined with isothermal calorimetry and 1H NMR experiments, to compute anion-dependent Gibbs free association energies ΔGa, as well as to evaluate intermolecular interactions. We find correlations between ΔGa and the anions’ solvation energies, which are exploited to calculate physico-chemical reaction parameters in the context of coordinating anions. Furthermore, we show that the binding situation within the (pseudo)rotaxanes can be mostly understood by straight-forward electrostatic considerations. However, quantum-chemical effects such as dispersion and charge-transfer interactions become more and more relevant when WCAs are employed.",

            "abstract": "In this study, the tautomeric equilibrium of a sequence of 1-benzamidoisoquinoline derivatives was investigated with the tools of NMR spectroscopy and computational chemistry. The equilibrium between different tautomers in these systems could be controlled via the substitution effect, and the relative content of the amide form varied from 74% for the strong electron-donating NMe2 substituent to 38% for the strong electron-accepting NO2 group in the phenyl ring. In contrast to the previously investigated 2-phenacylquinoline derivatives, the most stable and thus most abundant tautomer in the 1-benzamidoisoquinoline series except the two most electron-accepting substituents was an amide. The intramolecular hydrogen bond present in the enol tautomer competed with the intermolecular hydrogen bonds created with the solvent molecules and thus was not a sufficient factor to favor this tautomer in the mixture. Although routinely computational studies of tautomeric equilibrium are performed within the continuum solvent models, it is proven here that the inclusion of the explicit solvent is mandatory in order to reproduce the experimental tendencies observed for this type of system, facilitating strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds.",

In this scope, organic batteries attracted considerable attention. To overcome the shortcomings of typically applied materials from the classes of redox-active conjugated polymers (i.?e., unstable cell voltages) and soft matter-embedded stable organic radicals (i.?e., low conductivity), a novel design concept was introduced, integrating such stable radicals within a conductive polymer backbone. In the present theory-driven design approach, redox-active (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyls (TEMPOs) were incorporated in thiophene-based polymer model systems, while structure-property relationships governing the thermodynamic properties as well as the charge transfer kinetics underlying the charging and discharging processes were investigated in a systematical approach. Thereby, the impact of the substitution pattern, the length as well as the nature of the chemical linker, and the ratio of TEMPO and thiophene units was studied using state-of-the-art quantum chemical and quantum dynamical simulations for a set of six molecular model systems. Finally, two promising candidates were synthesized and electrochemically characterized, paving the way to applications in the frame of novel organic radical batteries.",

We show this for systems ranging from the fluoride ion and the bifluoride ion [FHF]− to polyhalogen anions [ClFx]−. Discrepancies between computed and experimental shifts when using continuum solvent models like COSMO or force-field-based descriptions like the 3D-RISM-SCF model show specific orbital interactions that require a quantum-mechanical treatment of the solvent molecules. This is confirmed by orbital analyses of the shielding constants, while less negatively charged fluorine atoms (e. g., in [EF4]−) do not require such quantum-mechanical treatments to achieve reasonable accuracy. The larger 19F solvent shift of fluoride in MeCN compared to water is due to the larger coordination number in the former. These observations are due to unusually strong charge-assisted C−H⋅⋅⋅F− hydrogen bonds, which manifest beyond some threshold negative natural charge on fluorine of ca. < −0.6 e. The interactions are accompanied by sizable free energies of solvation, in the order F−≫[FHF]−>[ClF2]−>[ClF4]−. COSMO-RS solvation free energies tend to moderately underestimate those from the micro-solvated cluster treatment. Red-shifted and intense vibrational C−H stretching bands, potentially accessible in bulk solution, are further spectroscopic finger prints.",

The sense of asymmetric induction of the catalyst in these reactions is opposite to those in prior reports. Moreover, in the presence of the same acid catalyst, the reactions with β-2-propenyl substituted allylic boronate generated homoallylic alcohol products with S absolute configuration.

Here, we describe the semisynthesis of twenty-one betaxanthins derived from proteinogenic amino acids, including the elusive betaxanthin of l-cysteine and two betaxanthins derived from l-lysine, and rationalize their antioxidant properties in mechanistic terms. The antioxidant capacity and redox potential of these betaxanthins were compared to those of model betaxanthins derived from dopamine, l-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), and pyrrolidine and structure–property relationships were established by using matched molecular pair analysis and a model developed using a genetic algorithm. Either a phenol or indole moiety enhance the antioxidant capacity of betaxanthins, which is overall much higher than that of their amino acid precursors and standard antioxidants, except for the cysteine-betaxanthin. The one-electron oxidation of amino acid betaxanthins produces radicals stabilized in multiple centers, as demonstrated by quantum chemical calculations.",

            "abstract": "An integrated experimental–computational strategy for the accurate characterization of the conformational landscape of flexible biomolecule building blocks is proposed. This is based on the combination of rotational spectroscopy with quantum-chemical computations guided by artificial intelligence tools. The first step of the strategy is the conformer search and relative stability evaluation performed by means of an evolutionary algorithm. In this step, last generation semiempirical methods are exploited together with hybrid and double-hybrid density functionals. Next, the barriers ruling the interconversion between the low-lying conformers are evaluated in order to unravel the possible fast relaxation paths. The relative stabilities and spectroscopic parameters of the “surviving” conformers are then refined using state-of-the-art composite schemes. The reliability of the computational procedure is further improved by the inclusion of vibrational and thermal effects. The final step of the strategy is the comparison between experiment and theory without any ad hoc adjustment, which allows an unbiased assignment of the spectroscopic features in terms of different conformers and their spectroscopic parameters. The proposed approach has been tested and validated for homocysteine, a highly flexible non-proteinogenic α-amino acid. The synergism of the integrated strategy allowed for the characterization of five conformers stabilized by bifurcated N–H2⋯O=C hydrogen bonds, together with an additional conformer involving a more conventional HN⋯H–O hydrogen bond. The stability order estimated from the experimental intensities as well as the number and type of conformers observed in the gas phase are in full agreement with the theoretical predictions. Analogously, a good match has been found for the spectroscopic parameters.",

At physiological pH (pH = 7.4), these sensors exhibited high selectivities for Zn2+ over a wide range of competing metal cations, displaying high sensitivities with a limit of detections of 120, 81.7 and 79.2 nM, respectively. This suggests that these sensors can detect chronic Zn2+ concentration for freshwater (>1.84 μM), designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. DFT simulations performed on the more stable stacked conformations of unbound and Zn2+ bounded states suggested that the latter display higher density of excited states than the unbound sensors. Moreover, the stacked conformer of sensor 3 was significantly more stable as compared to sensors 1 and 2, which was attributed to a stronger Van Der Waals (VDW) interaction between DQA and 1,8-naphthalimide. The Zn2+ binding leads to enhanced electronic coupling between the HOMOs and LUMOs, making excited states more populated which then undergoes geometric relaxation before emitting light and relaxing back to the ground states. The lower energy separation (5.0 eV) between the HOMO and the first Zn2+ d-orbital in sensor 3 as compared to sensors 1 and 2 results in enhanced density of the generated states and subsequently higher intensity upon binding with Zn2+.",

The development and analysis of modified RNA molecules benefit from advanced mass spectrometry and require sufficient understanding of fragmentation processes. Analogous to the degradation of RNA in solution by autohydrolysis, backbone cleavage of RNA strands was equally observed in the gas phase; however, the fragmentation mechanism remained elusive. In this work, autohydrolysis-like intermediates were generated from isolated RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase and investigated using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets. Data from both experiment and density functional theory provide evidence for the formation of a five-membered cyclic phosphate intermediate and rule out linear or six-membered structures. Furthermore, the experiments show that another prominent condensed-phase reaction of RNA nucleotides can be induced in the gas phase: the tautomerization of cytosine. Both observed reactions are therefore highly universal and intrinsic properties of the investigated molecules.",

Here, a systematic survey of the whole protein structure database discloses that NOS bridges are ubiquitous redox switches in proteins of all domains of life and are found in diverse structural motifs and chemical variants. In several instances, lysines are observed in simultaneous linkage with two cysteines, forming a sulfur–oxygen–nitrogen–oxygen–sulfur (SONOS) bridge with a trivalent nitrogen, which constitutes an unusual native branching cross-link. In many proteins, the NOS switch contains a functionally essential lysine with direct roles in enzyme catalysis or binding of substrates, DNA or effectors, linking lysine chemistry and redox biology as a regulatory principle. NOS/SONOS switches are frequently found in proteins from human and plant pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and also in many human proteins with established roles in gene expression, redox signaling and homeostasis in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",

Henry’s constants for CO2 were obtained under moderate pressures (2 to 10 atm) at 303.15, 318.15, 333.15 and 348.15 K. Comparison of CO2 affinity with dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol (DMPEG) and ionic liquids (ILs) indicated that [ME, ME, ME] and [F, ME, F] are excellent candidates as novel physical solvents for CO2 capture. DFT calculations were performed to understand the structure–property-performance relationships for the CO2 absorption mechanism.

This study shows, however, that an OSDA lacking strong specificity towards any particular zeolite may provide opportunities for discovery when other synthesis parameters are systematically screened. Thus, 1-methyl-2-ethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium has allowed to crystallize the new large/medium pore zeolite HPM-16 as well as the recently reported extra-large pore -SYT and the medium/small pore and chiral STW. The sophisticated OSDA originally affording -SYT and the new simple OSDA have very little in common, both in terms of size, shape and flexibility, while both may still direct the synthesis of the same zeolite. In fact, molecular simulations show that the new OSDA is located in three different positions of the -SYT structure, including the discrete 8MR where the original organic could not fit.",

Herein we use cryogenic gas-phase infrared spectroscopy to systematically investigate different kinds of isomerism in immunologically relevant glycolipids. We show that all structural features, including isomeric glycan headgroups, anomeric configurations and different lipid moieties, can be unambiguously resolved by diagnostic spectroscopic fingerprints in a narrow spectral range. The results allow for the characterization of isomeric glycolipid mixtures and biological applications.",

The latter reveals systematic deviations for ring strain and secondary π interactions, but otherwise a remarkably robust correction and correlation model based on hybrid DFT with a minimally augmented triple-zeta basis set is obtained, whereas GGA functionals perform significantly worse. Raw experimental data in the 3560–3700 cm−1 wavenumber range as well as computed geometries of all conformations invite further vibrational and structural benchmarking at the onset of hydrogen bonding. Beyond this diol-probed threshold, the accurate prediction of hydrogen bond induced shifts of different magnitudes remains one of the challenges for DFT functionals.",

In some instances, their chameleonic behavior changes to superchameleonic when they are involved in homodimerization processes, with the two initially identical isocyanide units adopting different roles along the reaction coordinate. We present here a detailed analysis of the computed non-least motion pathway that two isocyanides, the superchameleonic F–NC and, for the sake of comparison, the standard Me–NC, follow when reacting with themselves by comparing the evolution of a series of representative geometrical and electronic parameters along the respective reaction coordinates. This study shows that the two F–NC units are notoriously distinguishable from each other in all the parameters under scrutiny. Furthermore, we envisage that the superchameleonic character of F–NC seems to be most likely due to a minimal electrostatic interaction between the two entities at the earliest stage of the reaction. We also show that MeO–NC, MeS–NC and Me3PN–NC might be postulated as new examples of superchameleonic isocyanides.",

These different effects depend on the steric hindrance, on the allowed conformations of the complexes and on the presence of hydrophilic regions in [Ru2(EB776)4Cl], which overall lead to a lower “steric protection”.",

            "abstract": "The density functional theory method was performed to study the electronic structures of planar (pGN), corrugated (cGN) graphitic carbon nitride and their interactions with titanium dioxide cluster (TiO2)7. The transfer of photoinduced electrons was analyzed and electronic excitations were calculated. The obtained results show that cGN is thermodynamically more stable than pGN. cGN chemically interacts with titanium dioxide clusters, while the interaction between pGN and the cluster is assigned to physical nature. The combination of cGN and pGN with (TiO2)7 reduces the energy of the first excited states compared to that of the pure substances. The photocatalytic activities were estimated based on hypotheses on the location of the reduction and oxidation sites, the distance between the photoinduced holes and electrons and the electron density of molecular orbitals involved in the excitation. cGN/TiO2 is predicted to have a higher photocatalytic activity than pGN/TiO2.",

Analogous experiments with enantiopure trans-1,2-cyclohexanediol reveal the spectral signature of at least three unsymmetric homochiral dimers. A comparison to signal-enhanced spectra of 1,2-ethanediol and to calculations uncovers at least three transiently homochiral dimer contributions as well. In few of these dimer structures, the intramolecular OH⋯O contact present in monomeric 1,2-diols survives, despite the kinetic control in supersonic jet expansions. This provides further insights into the dimerisation mechanism of conformationally semi-flexible molecules in supersonic jets. Racemisation upon dimerisation is shown to be largely quenched under jet cooling conditions, whereas it should be strongly energy-driven at higher temperatures. The pronounced energetic preference for heterochiral aggregation of vicinal diols is also discussed in the context of chirality-induced spin selectivity.",

            "abstract": "Heteroaromatic stacking interactions are important in drug binding, supramolecular chemistry, and materials science, making protein–ligand model systems of these interactions of considerable interest. Here we studied 30 congeneric ligands that each present a distinct heteroarene for stacking between tyrosine residues at the dimer interface of procaspase-6. Complex X-ray crystal structures of 10 analogs showed that stacking geometries were well conserved, while high-accuracy computations showed that heteroarene stacking energy was well correlated with predicted overall ligand binding energies. Empirically determined KD values in this system thus provide a useful measure of heteroarene stacking with tyrosine. Stacking energies are discussed in the context of torsional strain, the number and positioning of heteroatoms, tautomeric state, and coaxial orientation of heteroarene in the stack. Overall, this study provides an extensive data set of empirical and high-level computed binding energies in a versatile new protein–ligand system amenable to studies of other intermolecular interactions.",
